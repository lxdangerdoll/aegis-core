**Tools**: InfluxDB query optimization, Grafana dashboard templates

### Priority 3: ADVANCED (High Impact, High Effort)

## Conclusion

WhisperEngine has **solid InfluxDB foundation** for basic temporal metrics but **MISSING 80% of operational character intelligence metrics**. Our 5 major operational systems (4,000+ lines total) are generating valuable performance data that isn't being captured.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**: Add missing metrics collection methods and integrate character intelligence systems with InfluxDB for complete operational visibility and ML training data.

**ROI**: High - Enables performance optimization, ML training, and operational monitoring for production character intelligence systems.
