FIXES: v1.0.6 â†’ v1.0.24 upgrade issue where 'assistant' character exists
       but has no personality/voice/mode data in new CDL tables.
       
This migration automatically populates the missing CDL data for users
upgrading from v1.0.6 who had the default assistant character.

SAFE: Uses INSERT...ON CONFLICT to only update if data is missing.
