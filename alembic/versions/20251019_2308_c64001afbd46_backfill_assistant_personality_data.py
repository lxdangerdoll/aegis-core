Revises: 9c23e4e81011
Create Date: 2025-10-19 23:08:43.557800+00:00

FIXES: v1.0.6 â†’ v1.0.24 upgrade issue where 'assistant' character exists
       but has no personality/voice/mode data in new CDL tables.
       
This migration automatically populates the missing CDL data for users
upgrading from v1.0.6 who had the default assistant character.

SAFE: Uses INSERT...ON CONFLICT to only update if data is missing.

CORRECTED SCHEMA: Now uses personality_traits, communication_styles, 
character_values tables (not the incorrect character_personalities, 
character_voices, character_modes tables that don't exist).

DEPENDENCY: Requires 9c23e4e81011 (creates personality_traits table)
