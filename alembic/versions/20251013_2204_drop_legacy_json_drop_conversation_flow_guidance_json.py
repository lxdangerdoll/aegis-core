Description:
    Drops the legacy conversation_flow_guidance JSON column from communication_styles table.
    
    This column contained 2-6KB JSON blobs that were dumping all conversation modes into prompts.
    Data has been migrated to normalized tables:
    - character_conversation_modes (mode definitions)
    - character_mode_guidance (avoid/encourage patterns)
    - character_mode_examples (usage examples)
    
    Removing this legacy field:
    1. Eliminates prompt bloat (~3KB per character)
    2. Removes data duplication
    3. Forces proper usage of normalized tables
    4. Cleans up database schema
