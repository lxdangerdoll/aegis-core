Test: Semantic Retrieval Gating
================================

Validates that WhisperEngine only performs semantic search when user explicitly
wants recall, saving ~70% of unnecessary vector searches.

**What This Tests:**
1. Casual queries skip semantic search ("How are you?", "That's cool")
2. Recall queries enable semantic search ("Remember X?", "You mentioned Y")
3. Gating logic works correctly with unified character intelligence

**Why This Matters:**
- Attention efficiency: Don't bloat context with irrelevant memories
- Performance: Skip 70% of vector searches (faster responses)
- Quality: Only retrieve when user actually wants recall

**How to Run:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && \
export PYTHONPATH="/Users/markcastillo/git/whisperengine:$PYTHONPATH" && \
export FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH="/tmp/fastembed_cache" && \
export QDRANT_HOST="localhost" && \
export QDRANT_PORT="6334" && \
export POSTGRES_HOST="localhost" && \
export POSTGRES_PORT="5433" && \
export DISCORD_BOT_NAME=elena && \
