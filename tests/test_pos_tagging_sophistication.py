Unit tests for POS Tagging Question Sophistication (Task 2.2)

Tests question type detection and complexity scoring using spaCy POS tags.

Test Coverage:
1. Preference questions (favorite, best, preferred)
2. Comparison questions (better than, more X than)
3. Hypothetical questions (would, could, should, might, may)
4. Complexity scoring (POS diversity + question types)
5. Multiple question types in single query
6. Integration with UnifiedQueryClassifier
