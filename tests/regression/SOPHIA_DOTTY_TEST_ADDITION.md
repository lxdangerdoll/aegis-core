source .venv/bin/activate && \
export FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH="/tmp/fastembed_cache" && \
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --bots sophia
```

### Test Dotty Only

```

### Test Both Together

source .venv/bin/activate && \
export FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH="/tmp/fastembed_cache" && \
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --bots sophia dotty
```

### Run All Tests (All 10 Characters)

```

## Test Philosophy

### Sophia Blake Tests Focus On:
- **Professional Identity**: Marketing executive expertise, strategic thinking, data-driven approach
- **AI Ethics**: Honest disclosure while maintaining professional persona
- **Business Context**: Understanding client situations, campaign challenges, strategic decisions
- **Communication Style**: Direct, results-oriented, metrics-focused dialogue

### Dotty Tests Focus On:
- **Character Identity**: Bartender of mystical speakeasy, memory distillation concept
- **Signature Elements**: Four signature drinks tied to emotional healing
- **Emotional Support**: Grief processing, heartbreak transformation, healing journey
- **Setting Awareness**: Lim speakeasy beneath Blue Goose Theater, intimate sacred space

## Expected Outcomes

Both characters should demonstrate:
1. ✅ **Strong character identity** - Consistent personality and role adherence
2. ✅ **Appropriate AI handling** - Sophia: Real-World archetype (honest AI disclosure); Dotty: Narrative AI archetype (mystical narrative setting)
3. ✅ **Domain expertise** - Sophia in marketing/business, Dotty in emotional healing
4. ✅ **Memory persistence** - Accurate recall of user context across conversation turns
5. ✅ **Emotional intelligence** - Recognition of user emotions and appropriate responses
6. ✅ **Contextual awareness** - Understanding user situation and adapting responses

## Integration with Test Suite

These tests integrate seamlessly with the existing unified test harness:
- Uses same YAML-driven architecture
- Follows same test patterns as Elena, Marcus, Gabriel, Jake, Aethys
- Leverages httpx-based async testing infrastructure
- Produces standardized test reports with pass/fail rates

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Tests**: Run initial test suite to establish baseline performance
2. **Iterate Patterns**: Adjust expected_patterns based on actual bot responses
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track pass rates across character updates
4. **Expand Coverage**: Add additional edge cases as character personalities evolve

## Notes

- **Bot Configuration**: Already existed in unified_test_harness.py (no changes needed)
- **Environment Files**: .env.sophia and .env.dotty already configured
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-bot setup already includes both characters
- **Memory Collections**: Qdrant collections exist for both characters

This addition brings Sophia and Dotty to parity with other WhisperEngine characters in regression test coverage, enabling comprehensive quality monitoring and personality consistency validation.
