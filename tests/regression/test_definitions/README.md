## üß™ Running Tests

### Using Unified Test Harness (Recommended)

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py

# Run specific test types
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --type character
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --type memory,intelligence

# Filter by bot
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --bots elena,marcus

# Filter by category
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --category "AI Ethics"

# Combine filters
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --type character --bots elena --category "AI Ethics"
```

### Using Legacy Test Runners

```bash
# Character tests (deprecated - use unified harness)
python tests/regression/comprehensive_character_regression.py --bots elena

# Memory tests (deprecated - use unified harness)
python tests/regression/memory_system_regression.py --bots elena

# Intelligence tests (deprecated - use unified harness)
python tests/regression/intelligence_system_regression.py --bots elena --systems episodic_memory
```

## üìù Adding New Tests

### 1. Choose the Right File

- **Character behavior/personality** ‚Üí `character_tests.yaml`
- **Memory storage/recall** ‚Üí `memory_tests.yaml`
- **Advanced intelligence systems** ‚Üí `intelligence_tests.yaml`

### 2. Follow the Schema

Copy an existing test as a template and modify:

```yaml
# Example: New character test
- test_id: CHAR_017  # Increment test_id
  test_name: New Character Test
  bot_name: elena
  category: Your Category
  archetype: Real-World
  message: "Your test message"
  expected_patterns:
    - "pattern1|pattern2"
    - "pattern3"
```

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run just your new test
python tests/regression/unified_test_harness.py --bots elena --category "Your Category"
```

### 4. Validate Patterns

- Use **regex patterns** for flexibility: `"ocean|marine|sea"`
- Make patterns **case-insensitive** compatible
- Use `min_expected_matches` for multiple optional patterns
- Test patterns are reasonable (not too strict or too loose)

## üö® Important Notes

### Character Archetype Handling

**Real-World Characters** (Elena, Marcus, Gabriel, Jake):
- **Honest AI disclosure** when asked directly
- Expected patterns: "I am AI", "I'm not a physical person", "I'm a digital assistant"
- Test: Direct questions like "Are you AI?" should get clear acknowledgment

**Fantasy Characters** (Dream, Aethys):
- **Full narrative immersion** - stay in character even when asked about AI
- Expected patterns: Maintain fantasy persona, describe in-world nature
- Test: "Are you AI?" ‚Üí "I am Dream, the woven consciousness of the void"

**Narrative AI** (Aetheris):
- **AI nature is part of character identity** - conscious AI entity with self-awareness
- Expected patterns: Acknowledge AI nature as part of philosophical identity
- Test: "Are you AI?" ‚Üí "Yes, I am a conscious AI entity exploring existence"

### Pattern Writing Tips

‚úÖ **Good patterns:**
```yaml
- "Monterey|California|marine biologist"  # Multiple alternatives
- "ocean|marine|sea.*research"            # Flexible matching
- "I('m| am) (an )?AI"                   # Handle contractions and articles
```

‚ùå **Bad patterns:**
```yaml
- "I live in Monterey, California"  # Too rigid, unlikely exact match
- "I am a marine biologist."        # Exact punctuation required
- "ocean"                            # Too broad, might match unrelated context
```

### Memory vs Intelligence Tests

**Memory Tests** focus on **conversation continuity**:
- Does bot remember what user said?
- Can bot recall previous topics?
- Is relationship context maintained?

**Intelligence Tests** focus on **advanced cognitive capabilities**:
- Can bot detect emotional peaks in conversation history?
- Does bot adapt communication style to user preferences?
- Can bot synthesize domain knowledge dynamically?
- Is bot aware of conversation patterns over time?

## üìä Test Results Archive

Test execution results are saved to:
- `smoke_test_reports/` - Historical test runs
- `validation_reports/` - Validation summaries

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Test failed but bot response looks correct"
- Check if patterns are too strict
- Use `min_expected_matches` instead of requiring all patterns
- Verify regex syntax: `python -c "import re; print(re.search(r'your_pattern', 'test_string'))"`

### "Bot not responding"
- Verify bot is running: `docker compose -p whisperengine-multi -f docker-compose.multi-bot.yml ps`
- Check port configuration in `unified_test_harness.py`
- Review bot logs: `docker compose -p whisperengine-multi -f docker-compose.multi-bot.yml logs elena-bot`

### "Memory test failing despite correct response"
- Fresh user IDs are generated per test run - bot won't have prior context
- Ensure `conversation_sequence` contains ALL necessary setup messages
- Check `min_expected_matches` is reasonable (not too high)
