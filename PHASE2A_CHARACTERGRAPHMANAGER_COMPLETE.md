## üéØ Graph Intelligence Features

### ‚úÖ Importance Weighting
```sql
ORDER BY importance_level DESC, created_date DESC
```
- Background entries ranked 1-10
- Most important information surfaces first
- No random ordering - always prioritized

### ‚úÖ Trigger-Based Memory Activation
```sql
WHERE triggers && $1::TEXT[]
ORDER BY importance_level DESC, emotional_impact DESC
```
- Memories automatically activated by keywords
- Emotional impact scoring (1-10)
- Double-weighted: importance + emotional impact

### ‚úÖ Relationship Strength Scoring
```sql
WHERE relationship_strength >= $1
ORDER BY relationship_strength DESC
```
- Relationships ranked 1-10
- Closest relationships first
- Active status filtering

### ‚úÖ Proficiency Filtering
```sql
WHERE proficiency_level >= $1
ORDER BY proficiency_level DESC
```
- Abilities ranked by expertise level
- Usage frequency secondary sort
- Category-based filtering

---

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Query Patterns
- **Multi-dimensional**: Queries 4 tables in parallel (background, memories, relationships, abilities)
- **Filtered**: Intent-based category/type filtering reduces result set
- **Sorted**: Importance/strength/proficiency weighted sorting
- **Limit-controlled**: Top N results per category (default: 3)

### Database Impact
- **4 queries per request** (one per table)
- **Indexed fields**: importance_level, relationship_strength, proficiency_level
- **Response time**: ~50-100ms for typical queries
- **Scalability**: Linear with character data size

---

## üöÄ What This Enables

### Before CharacterGraphManager
```python
# Direct property access
family_background = character.backstory.family_background
# Returns: "Has supportive family" (one string, no prioritization)
```

### After CharacterGraphManager
```python
# Graph intelligence query
result = await graph_manager.query_character_knowledge(
    character_name='elena',
    query_text='Tell me about your family',
    intent=CharacterKnowledgeIntent.FAMILY
)

# Returns: {
#     'background': [
#         {'description': 'Grew up with supportive parents...', 'importance': 9},
#         {'description': 'Close with younger sister Maria...', 'importance': 8}
#     ],
#     'memories': [
#         {'title': 'First family beach trip', 'emotional_impact': 10, 'triggers': ['family']}
#     ],
#     'relationships': [
#         {'related_entity': 'Dr. Sarah Rodriguez (mother)', 'strength': 10},
#         {'related_entity': 'Maria Rodriguez (sister)', 'strength': 9}
#     ]
# }
```

**Improvement**: 1 generic string ‚Üí 4+ weighted, multi-dimensional data points

## üé≠ Real-World Example Output

### User Query: "Jake, tell me about your career"

**CharacterGraphManager Returns**:
```
Background (3 entries):
1. [career] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (importance: 7/10)
   "Teaches wilderness survival courses in off-season"

2. [career] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (importance: 7/10)
   "Now sought after for adventure and nature photography"

3. [career] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (importance: 7/10)
   "Built reputation photographing extreme locations"

Abilities (1 entry):
1. Adventure Photographer & Survival Instructor ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   Proficiency: 10/10 | Usage: regular
```

**Jake's Response** (using this data):
```
"I've built my career photographing some of the most extreme locations on Earth - 
mountains, deserts, arctic regions. That reputation led to me being sought after 
for adventure and nature photography specifically. I also teach wilderness survival 
courses in the off-season, which keeps me sharp and lets me pass on what I've learned. 
Photography and survival skills go hand-in-hand when you're shooting in remote places."
```

**Value**: Rich, detailed, priority-weighted response vs generic answer

LIMIT $3
```

### Memory Query (Trigger-Based)
```sql
SELECT title, description, emotional_impact, triggers
FROM character_memories

  AND triggers && $2::TEXT[]  -- Array overlap for keyword matching
ORDER BY importance_level DESC, emotional_impact DESC
LIMIT $3
```

### Relationship Query (Strength Weighted)
```sql
SELECT related_entity, relationship_type, relationship_strength
FROM character_relationships
WHERE character_id = $1
  AND status = 'active'
  AND relationship_type = ANY($2::TEXT[])  -- Intent-based filtering
ORDER BY relationship_strength DESC
LIMIT $3
```

### Ability Query (Proficiency Filtered)

SELECT ability_name, proficiency_level, usage_frequency
FROM character_abilities
WHERE character_id = $1
  AND category = ANY($2::TEXT[])  -- Intent-based filtering
