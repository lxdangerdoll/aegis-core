- **Communication Styles**: Configure response patterns and conversational behaviors
- **Values & Beliefs**: Set core values and ethical frameworks for characters
- **Knowledge Base**: Manage character-specific knowledge and experiences
- **Evolution History**: Track character development and adaptation patterns
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL backend for persistent CDL storage

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the application.

You can start editing the pages by modifying files in `src/app/`. The application auto-updates as you edit files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
