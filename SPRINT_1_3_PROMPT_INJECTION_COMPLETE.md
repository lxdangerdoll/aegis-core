# Sprint 1-3 Prompt Injection Complete + Naming Refactoring Plan

## ‚úÖ Sprint 1-3 Prompt Injection - COMPLETE

**Achievement**: Adaptive learning system now influences AI character behavior through prompt injection.

### What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Sprint 1-3 adaptive learning was calculating sophisticated metrics (trust, affection, attunement, conversation quality, confidence) and storing them in PostgreSQL, but the LLM had ZERO knowledge of them during response generation. The AI character couldn't adapt behavior based on relationship depth.

**Solution**: Implemented full prompt injection pipeline:

1. **Data Retrieval** (Phase 6.7 in message_processor.py, lines 224-226)
   - Call `_enrich_ai_components_with_adaptive_learning()` before response generation
   - Retrieves relationship scores from PostgreSQL
   - Adds Sprint 1-3 data to `ai_components` dict

2. **Data Integration** (message_processor.py, lines 572-589)
   - Add Sprint 1-3 data to `comprehensive_context` dict in `ai_components`
   - Ensures data flows through pipeline to CDL integration

3. **Pipeline Transfer** (message_processor.py, lines 2750-2773)
   - Transfer `comprehensive_context` to `pipeline_result.enhanced_context`
   - CDL integration reads from `enhanced_context`

4. **Prompt Formatting** (cdl_ai_integration.py, lines 515-560)
   - Extract Sprint 1-3 data from `enhanced_context`
   - Map relationship_depth to human-readable guidance
   - Inject formatted guidance into system prompt

### Prompt Injection Output

```
üíù RELATIONSHIP (Sprint 3): You are becoming acquainted - be welcoming, respectful, and encouraging 
(Trust: 0.50, Affection: 0.40, Attunement: 0.30, Interactions: 0)

üìä CONFIDENCE (Sprint 1): exploratory conversation - ask clarifying questions and build understanding 
(Overall: 0.60, Context: 0.65)
```

### Validation

**Test**: Jake bot E2E test with direct prompt log inspection  
**Result**: ‚úÖ Sprint 1-3 data appears in system prompt  
**File**: `logs/prompts/Jake_20251006_190422_final_sprint_test.json`

### Key Code Changes

**src/core/message_processor.py**:
- Lines 572-589: Add Sprint data to `comprehensive_context` in `ai_components`
- Lines 2750-2773: Transfer to `pipeline_result.enhanced_context`

**src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py**:
- Lines 398-404: Extract `comprehensive_context` from `enhanced_context`
- Lines 515-560: Format and inject Sprint 1-3 guidance

## üîÑ Naming Refactoring Plan

### Problem Identified

**User feedback**: "can we stop naming variables, functions, python files as 'sprint3' or 'phase2' and such? it makes it really confusing to deploy code like that."

**Root cause**: Development phase names (sprint1, sprint2, sprint3, phase4) describe WHEN features were built, not WHAT they do. This creates confusion and makes code harder to understand.

### Solution

**Created**: `NAMING_REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive refactoring plan with naming conversion map.

### Key Naming Conversions

| Bad (Phase-Based) | Good (Semantic) | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `sprint3_relationship` | `relationship_state` | Relationship scores dict |
| `sprint1_confidence` | `conversation_confidence` | Conversation quality metrics |
| `sprint2_roberta` | `emotion_analysis` | RoBERTa emotion metadata |
| `phase4_intelligence` | `conversation_intelligence` | AI conversation components |
| `_update_sprint3_scores()` | `_update_relationship_scores()` | Method to update scores |
| `üîÑ SPRINT 3: Relationship updated` | `üîÑ RELATIONSHIP: Trust/affection/attunement updated` | Log message |

### Anti-Pattern Guidance Added

**Updated**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with new section:

```markdown
üö® CRITICAL NAMING CONVENTION: NO DEVELOPMENT PHASE NAMES IN PRODUCTION CODE!
- NEVER use development phase names: "sprint1", "sprint2", "sprint3", "phase4"
- USE SEMANTIC, DOMAIN-DRIVEN NAMES that describe WHAT code does, not WHEN built
- Examples of BAD names: sprint3_relationship, phase4_intelligence, sprint1_confidence
- Examples of GOOD names: relationship_state, conversation_intelligence, conversation_confidence
- Examples of GOOD names: relationship_state, conversation_intelligence, conversation_confidence
```

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1** (High Priority):
1. Rename core dictionary keys (`sprint3_relationship` ‚Üí `relationship_state`)
2. Update log messages (remove "SPRINT X" labels, use semantic labels)

**Phase 2**:
1. Rename test files to use semantic feature names
2. Rename migration scripts

**Phase 3**:
1. Update documentation with semantic terminology
2. Final code sweep for remaining phase-based names

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 Refactoring**: Start with variable renaming (dictionary keys and log messages)
2. **Test After Refactoring**: Ensure Jake bot E2E test still passes
3. **Phase 2 & 3**: File renaming and documentation updates
4. **Final Validation**: Complete E2E test with new naming conventions
