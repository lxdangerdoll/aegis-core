# 🧪 Test GitHub Actions Docker Workflow

## Quick Verification Commands

You can test the workflow without waiting for a full build:

### 1. **Check Workflow Syntax**
```bash
# GitHub provides a workflow syntax checker
gh workflow run docker-build-push.yml --ref main

# Or check locally with act (if installed)
act -n
```

### 2. **Test Manual Trigger**
Go to your repository:
1. **Actions** tab
2. **🐳 Docker Build and Push** workflow  
3. **Run workflow** button
4. ✅ Check **Push to Docker Hub**: `true`
5. **Run workflow**

### 3. **Test Push to Main**
```bash
# Any push to main branch will trigger the build
git commit -m "test: trigger docker build" --allow-empty
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 Secret Detection

The workflow automatically detects your existing secrets using **both naming conventions**:

### Supported Secret Names:
- ✅ `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` + `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` 
- ✅ `DOCKER_USERNAME` + `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- ✅ **Mixed** (e.g., `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` + `DOCKER_PASSWORD`)

### Verification:
```bash
# Check if workflow will detect your secrets
# Look at the build logs for this message:
# "Should push: true" = ✅ Secrets detected
# "Should push: false" = ❌ Secrets missing
```

## 📊 Expected Build Timeline

| Step | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Checkout | ~10s | Download repository |
| Docker Buildx | ~30s | Setup multi-platform builds |
| Docker Build | ~5-10min | Build image (cached after first run) |
| Docker Push | ~2-5min | Upload to Docker Hub |
| **Total** | **~8-15min** | First run (subsequent runs ~3-5min) |

## ✅ Success Indicators

Look for these in the GitHub Actions logs:

```
✅ Docker Hub login successful
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ Image pushed to whisperengine/whisperengine:latest
✅ Multi-platform manifest created
```

## 🎯 Post-Build Verification

After successful build, verify the image:

```bash
# Check Docker Hub
open "https://hub.docker.com/r/whisperengine/whisperengine"

# Test pull and run
docker pull whisperengine/whisperengine:latest
docker run --rm whisperengine/whisperengine:latest python -c "print('✅ Image works!')"
```
