# Bot: "Elena here! I'm fascinated by your interest in marine conservation. 
#       What specific ocean issues concern you most?"
# â†’ Track: QuestionType.OPINION, QuestionPriority.HIGH

# User: "Oh, I just saw this cool documentary about space!"
# â†’ Process: Question not answered, topic changed abruptly

# Bot: "Space documentaries can be amazing! The vastness reminds me of ocean depths.
#       Speaking of conservation - I'm still curious what ocean issues matter to you?"
# â†’ Natural callback to unanswered question

# User: "Actually, plastic pollution really bothers me"
# â†’ Process: Question answered! Mark resolved, high quality answer

# Bot: "That's such an important issue! I've seen the impact firsthand in my research.
#       What first made you aware of plastic pollution in our oceans?"
# â†’ Track: QuestionType.PERSONAL, QuestionPriority.MEDIUM

# This creates much more natural, persistent conversation flow!
