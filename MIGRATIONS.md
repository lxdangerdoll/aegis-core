# WhisperEngine Database Migrations üîÑ

> **Post-v1.0.6 Feature**: Professional database migration system using Alembic

## Overview

WhisperEngine now uses **Alembic** for safe, versioned database schema changes. All post-v1.0.6 releases will use migrations for schema updates.

## Quick Start

### For v1.0.6 Deployments (Existing Databases)

Your database already has the schema. Just mark it as current:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-core.txt

# 2. Mark database as up-to-date
./scripts/migrations/db-migrate.sh stamp head

# 3. Verify
./scripts/migrations/db-migrate.sh status
```

### For New Installations

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-core.txt

# 2. Run migrations
./scripts/migrations/db-migrate.sh upgrade

# 3. Verify
./scripts/migrations/db-migrate.sh status
```

## Creating Migrations

```bash
# 1. Generate migration file
./scripts/migrations/db-migrate.sh create "Add your feature description"

# 2. Edit the generated file in alembic/versions/
# 3. Test migration
./scripts/migrations/db-migrate.sh upgrade

# 4. Commit to git
git add alembic/versions/[generated_file].py
git commit -m "feat: Your migration description"
```

## Docker Integration

Migrations run **automatically** when containers start. No manual steps needed!

```bash
docker-compose up -d  # Migrations run before app starts
```
