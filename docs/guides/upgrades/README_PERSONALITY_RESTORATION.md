## 🔮 For Future Installations

**Good news:** This issue is now fixed in v1.0.24+ seed data!

New installations automatically include complete personality data. This guide is only needed for users who:
- Upgraded from v1.0.6
- Have existing assistant with missing personality data

---

## 📝 Notes for Technical Users

**Database Schema Changes (v1.0.6 → v1.0.24):**
- Added: `character_personalities` table (Big Five traits)
- Added: `character_voices` table (speaking style)
- Added: `character_modes` table (conversation modes)
- Added: `communication_styles` table (response preferences)
- Migrated: `ai_identity_handling` removed from old table
- Updated: Seed data now includes personality for new installs

**Migration Files:**
- Baseline: `alembic/versions/20251011_baseline_v106.py`
- Personality tables: Multiple migrations between Oct 12-19
- Seed update: `sql/01_seed_data.sql` (now includes personality)

---

## 🎓 Understanding the Fix

**Why personality was lost:**

v1.0.6 seed data created this:
```sql
INSERT INTO characters (name, occupation, description)
VALUES ('AI Assistant', 'AI Assistant', 'A helpful assistant');
```

v1.0.24 needs this PLUS:
```sql
INSERT INTO character_personalities (openness, conscientiousness, ...)
INSERT INTO character_voices (tone, pace, formality, ...)
INSERT INTO character_modes (mode_name, description, ...)
```

The migration added the NEW tables but didn't populate them for EXISTING characters. This guide fixes that gap.

**Choose your method above and get started! Your assistant's personality will be back in 10-15 minutes.** 🎉
