## 🎯 Making the Right Choice

### **Choose Local Mode If:**
- Privacy is your top priority
- You handle sensitive information

- You're comfortable with local AI models
- You primarily use desktop applications

### **Choose Cloud Mode If:**
- You want the best AI capabilities
- You work across multiple platforms
- You collaborate with teams
- You want image/vision analysis

## 🔄 Can I Switch Between Modes?

**No** - These are separate deployment architectures by design. This ensures:
- Clear privacy boundaries
- No accidental data leakage
- Honest marketing about capabilities
- User certainty about their data

If you want both experiences, you can:
1. Run separate installations
2. Use different devices
3. Choose the mode that best fits your primary use case
