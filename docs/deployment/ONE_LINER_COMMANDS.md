## One-Liner Commands Reference

### Setup Commands (No Git Required)

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/setup-containerized.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell (Recommended):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/setup-containerized.ps1" -OutFile "setup.ps1"; .\setup.ps1
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/setup-containerized.bat -o setup.bat && setup.bat
```

**Note:** Windows PowerShell users should use the native `.ps1` script, not the `.bat` file, to avoid `curl` alias conflicts.

### Cleanup Commands (No Git Required)

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/cleanup-docker.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/cleanup-docker.ps1" -OutFile "cleanup.ps1"; .\cleanup.ps1
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/cleanup-docker.bat -o cleanup.bat && cleanup.bat
```

## User Flow

### Standard Flow
1. User runs setup command
2. Configures LLM API key
3. Starts using WhisperEngine

### Recovery Flow (When Issues Occur)
1. User encounters database migration error
2. Sees error message or checks README/docs
3. Runs cleanup one-liner command
4. Runs setup one-liner command again
5. System works cleanly

### No Git Required!
- End users never need to clone repository
- All commands work via direct GitHub raw file access
- Simple copy/paste from documentation
- Works on all platforms

## Benefits

### For End Users
✅ No Git installation required
✅ No repository cloning needed
✅ Simple copy/paste commands
✅ Works identically on all platforms
✅ Easy to share (just URL)

### For Support
✅ Single canonical cleanup solution
✅ Reduces support burden
✅ Easy to reference in issues/discussions
✅ Version controlled (always latest from main branch)

### For Documentation
✅ Consistent commands across all docs
✅ Easy to maintain (update scripts, docs stay current)
✅ Links directly to GitHub for latest version
✅ Searchable and discoverable

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
1. `README.md` - Added troubleshooting and cleanup sections
2. `docs/deployment/CLEANUP_SCRIPTS.md` - Added one-liner commands

### Created
1. `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - New cheat sheet
2. `docs/troubleshooting/README.md` - New troubleshooting guide
3. `docs/deployment/ONE_LINER_COMMANDS.md` - This file

## Testing Required

Before deploying to production, test:

- [ ] macOS cleanup one-liner downloads and executes correctly
- [ ] Linux cleanup one-liner downloads and executes correctly
- [ ] Windows PowerShell cleanup one-liner works
- [ ] Windows CMD cleanup one-liner works
- [ ] All GitHub raw URLs are correct
- [ ] Scripts are executable after download
- [ ] Cleanup → Setup flow works end-to-end

## Deployment Checklist

1. **Commit all files:**
   ```bash
   git add README.md QUICK_REFERENCE.md docs/
   git commit -m "Add one-liner cleanup commands and enhanced documentation"
   ```

2. **Push to main branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify GitHub raw URLs work:**
   - Test each cleanup URL in browser
   - Verify files download correctly

4. **Update any external documentation:**
   - Discord announcements
   - Website documentation
   - Support articles

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Versioned URLs:** Allow users to pin to specific version
   ```bash
   # Example with version tag
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/v1.0.0/cleanup-docker.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Interactive Cleanup:** Add options to preserve certain data
   ```bash
   # Example with options
   ./cleanup.sh --keep-database --keep-logs
   ```

3. **Cleanup Verification:** Show what will be deleted before confirming
   ```bash
   # Example dry-run mode
   ./cleanup.sh --dry-run
   ```

4. **Backup Integration:** Automatically backup before cleanup
   ```bash
   # Example with backup
   ./cleanup.sh --backup=/path/to/backup
   ```
