# üõ†Ô∏è Security Validation Bug Fix

## Issue
The emoji reaction evaluation was failing with:
```
ERROR - Error in emoji reaction evaluation: name 'security_validation_result' is not defined
```

## Root Cause
In `src/handlers/events.py` line 2317, the code was trying to reference `security_validation_result` which was not defined in the `_generate_and_send_response` function scope.

## Fix Applied
Changed line 2317 from:
```python
security_validation_result=security_validation_result,
```

To:
```python
security_validation_result=getattr(self, '_last_security_validation', None),
```

## Explanation
The security validation result is stored as `self._last_security_validation` in the class instance during message processing. The fix uses `getattr()` with a safe fallback to None to prevent the NameError.

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED**: Elena bot rebuilt and restarted with the bug fix
‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: No more security validation errors in logs
‚úÖ **READY**: Web search emoji prefix feature is now working properly without errors

The emoji reaction system now works correctly alongside the new web search üåê emoji prefix functionality.
