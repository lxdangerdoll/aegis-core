# Memory Hallucination Bug Fix

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Reporter**: User (Discord ID: 672814231002939413)  
**Affected Bot**: Jake (Adventure Photographer) - likely affects all bots  
**Severity**: HIGH - Core memory system malfunction

## Summary

Jake bot was giving completely hallucinated responses about past conversations that never happened. Investigation revealed **five cascading bugs** in the memory system that caused severe context truncation (down to 136 characters!) and format mismatches.

## Original Problem

User reported: *"Jake bot doesn't seem to remember things we talked about. He's giving total hallucination."*

Example hallucinated response from Jake:
> "Last we talked, you were wrestling with that dream—you know, the one where the canyon walls whispered back at you..."

**Reality**: User never discussed any dreams, canyons, or whispering walls.

## Root Cause Analysis

Investigation using prompt logs (`logs/prompts/*.json`) revealed the LLM was receiving only **136 characters** of memory context instead of thousands of characters. This cascaded through five separate bugs:

### Bug #1: Memory Content Truncation (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `src/core/message_processor.py` lines 1390-1403

**Problem**: Memory content truncated to 120 characters BEFORE summarization
```python
# BEFORE (BUG):
memory_text = f"[Memory: {content[:120]}]"  # Truncated too early!

# AFTER (FIX):
memory_text = f"[Memory: {content[:500]}]"  # Preserve context for summarization
```

**Impact**: Memories like "We discussed marine biology career paths and favorite documentaries about coral reefs" became "We discussed marine bio..." - losing all semantic meaning.

---

### Bug #2: Metadata Extraction Fallback Truncation

**Location**: `src/core/message_processor.py` lines 1404-1432

**Problem**: Fallback metadata extraction also truncated to 100-120 chars
```python
# BEFORE (BUG):
user_msg = md.get("user_message", "")[:100]
bot_resp = md.get("bot_response", "")[:120]

# AFTER (FIX):
user_msg = md.get("user_message", "")[:300]
bot_resp = md.get("bot_response", "")[:300]
```

**Impact**: Legacy code path that rarely executes, but contributed to truncation when metadata format was used.

---

### Bug #3: Conversation Summary Generation (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `src/core/message_processor.py` lines 1856-1920 (`_create_conversation_summary()`)

**Problem**: Function expected paired "User: X Bot: Y" format that storage never created, PLUS truncated final output to 50 chars
```python
# BEFORE (BUG):
if "User:" in clean_content and "Bot:" in clean_content:
    # Extract conversation parts - NEVER MATCHED!
    return f"Discussed X: {content[:50]}"  # Super truncated!
else:
    return content[:50]  # Fallback also truncated!

# AFTER (FIX):
# Works with actual individual message format
content_preview = clean_content[:400]  # 8x more context!
return f"Discussed topic: {content_preview}"  # Full semantic context preserved
```

**Impact**: Summaries like "Discussed beach/ocean activities: User asked about diving spots in the Caribbean and shared photos of bioluminescent plankton" became "Discussed beach/ocean activities: User ask..." - completely losing the actual conversation content.

**Architecture Note**: Messages are stored individually (`user_message` and `bot_response` as separate entries) by design for better semantic search. The summarization function had legacy assumptions about paired format.

---

### Bug #4: Recent Conversations Never Included (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `src/core/message_processor.py` lines 1468-1497

**Problem**: `recent_conversation_parts` array was created and populated BUT NEVER USED
```python
# BEFORE (BUG):
recent_conversation_parts = []
# ... populate array with recent (<2 hours) conversations
# ... NEVER PROCESSED OR ADDED TO MEMORY NARRATIVE!

# AFTER (FIX):
recent_conversation_parts = []
# ... populate array
# NEW: Process and extract content
for part in recent_conversation_parts:
    clean_part = part.replace('[Memory:', '').strip()
    recent_conversation_summaries.append(clean_part[:1500])
# Add to memory narrative
memory_parts.append("RECENT CONVERSATIONS: " + "; ".join(unique_recent))
```

**Impact**: Users who chatted sporadically (conversations >2 hours apart) got ZERO recent context. Only older summaries (if any) were included. This was a **dead variable bug** - code existed but never executed.

---

### Bug #5: Recent Message Character Limit Too Low

**Location**: `src/core/message_processor.py` line 1487

**Problem**: Recent messages (kept verbatim for continuity) truncated to only 400 characters
```python
# BEFORE (BUG):
recent_conversation_summaries.append(clean_part[:400])  # Too short!

# AFTER (FIX):
recent_conversation_summaries.append(clean_part[:1500])  # Discord messages can be up to 2000 chars
```

**Impact**: Discord allows 2000 character messages. Truncating to 400 chars meant losing 80% of longer messages, breaking conversation continuity.

**Context Limits**:
- Recent messages: 1500 chars × 10 messages = 15,000 chars max
- Older summaries: 400 chars × 5 summaries = 2,000 chars max
- Total memory context: ~17,000 chars (reasonable for LLM context windows)

---

### Bug #6: No Anti-Hallucination Guidance

**Location**: `src/core/message_processor.py` lines 1673-1681

**Problem**: When no memories exist, LLM received no guidance about what to do
```python
# ADDED (NEW):
if not memory_narrative or len(memory_narrative.strip()) < 10:
    system_messages.append({
        "role": "system",
        "content": "⚠️ MEMORY STATUS: No previous conversation history found. "
                   "If asked about past conversations, politely say you don't have "
                   "specific memories of those discussions yet. DO NOT invent or "
                   "hallucinate conversation details."
    })
```

**Impact**: LLMs are trained to be helpful and will invent plausible content when asked about past conversations if no guidance is given. This explicit warning tells the LLM to admit when it doesn't have memories.

---

## The Cascading Effect

These bugs compounded:
1. Content truncated to 120 chars during wrapping
2. Recent conversations never processed (dead variable)
3. Remaining content summarized with format mismatch → fell back to 50 char truncation
4. Recent messages limited to 400 chars
5. **Final result**: ~136 characters of useless context delivered to LLM
6. LLM had no guidance about missing memories

**Before fixes**: "USER FACTS: [Preferred name: Mark] RECENT CONVERSATIONS: *leans against a sun-war..." (136 chars)

**After fixes**: "USER FACTS: [Preferred name: Mark]; [cats]; [Minerva, Luna]; RECENT CONVERSATIONS: [1500 chars per message × 10 messages]..." (15,000+ chars possible)

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- **Jake bot**: Total hallucinations about dreams, canyons, creative struggles (none of this happened)
- **Memory context**: 136 characters
- **User experience**: "He's making up entire conversations"

### After Fixes
- **Elena bot**: 2,805 characters of memory context, mostly accurate recall (cats, sushi, pizza, sharks - all real topics)
- **Jake bot**: 1,820 characters of memory context, improved but partial hallucinations remain

### Remaining Architectural Issue (Out of Scope)

**Hallucination Feedback Loop**: Bot responses are stored as memories (by design for conversation continuity) and get retrieved when user asks "what did we talk about?". This creates a feedback loop where:
1. Bot hallucinates response → stored as memory
2. User asks "what did we discuss?" → semantic search retrieves bot's own response
3. Bot sees own hallucination as "memory" → hallucinates further
4. Cycle repeats

**Why this happens**:
- Memory storage: Individual `user_message` and `bot_response` entries (by design for semantic search)
- Semantic search: Can't distinguish user intent ("show topics" vs "show conversation")
- Query: "What did we talk about?" matches bot responses semantically

**Why it's acceptable**:
- Needed for conversation continuity (bot needs previous context)
- Requires intent detection to solve properly (complex)
- Tradeoff between continuity and hallucination risk
- Real bugs (truncation) are now fixed

## Two-Tier Memory Architecture

The system uses a time-based memory structure:

### Tier 1: RECENT CONVERSATIONS (<2 hours old)
- Kept **verbatim** (no summarization)
- Up to **1500 chars per message** (was 400)
- Max **10 recent exchanges**
- **Purpose**: Immediate conversation continuity
- **Total**: Up to 15,000 chars

### Tier 2: PAST CONVERSATION SUMMARIES (>2 hours old)
- Goes through **`_create_conversation_summary()`**
- Semantic categorization (beach, food, photography, etc.)
- Up to **400 chars per summary**
- Max **5 summaries**
- **Purpose**: Compressed long-term memory
- **Total**: Up to 2,000 chars

## Files Modified

1. **`src/core/message_processor.py`**
   - Lines 1390-1403: Increased memory wrapping limit (120→500 chars)
   - Lines 1404-1432: Increased metadata fallback limits (100-120→300 chars)
   - Lines 1468-1497: Fixed dead variable bug (process `recent_conversation_parts`)
   - Lines 1487: Increased recent message limit (400→1500 chars)
   - Lines 1673-1681: Added anti-hallucination warning
   - Lines 1856-1920: Rewrote `_create_conversation_summary()` for actual storage format
   - Lines 1787: Increased summary snippet limit (200→400 chars)

## Deployment

```bash
# Restart affected bots to apply fixes
./multi-bot.sh restart jake
./multi-bot.sh restart elena
# Or restart all bots
./multi-bot.sh restart all
```

## Verification

Check prompt logs to verify increased context:
```bash
ls -lht logs/prompts/jake_*672814231002939413.json | head -1
cat logs/prompts/jake_20251011_141942_672814231002939413.json | jq '.messages[] | select(.role=="system") | .content' | grep "RELEVANT MEMORIES" -A 50
```

Look for:
- ✅ USER FACTS section present
- ✅ RECENT CONVERSATIONS section present (if messages <2 hours old)
- ✅ PAST CONVERSATION SUMMARIES section (if messages >2 hours old)
- ✅ Each section has substantial content (1000+ chars typical)

## Timeline

**Bug Introduction**: Likely existed since vector memory system implementation (multiple sprints ago)

**Discovery**: October 11, 2025 - User reported Jake bot hallucinations

**Root Cause Identified**: October 11, 2025 - Prompt log analysis revealed 136 char context

**Fixes Applied**: October 11, 2025 - All five bugs fixed, bots restarted

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (with acceptable architectural tradeoff documented)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Prompt logging is critical**: Without `logs/prompts/*.json` files, this bug would have been impossible to diagnose
2. **Character limits compound**: Multiple small truncations (120→50→400) create massive information loss
3. **Dead variables are dangerous**: Code that looks functional but never executes (recent_conversation_parts)
4. **Format assumptions fail**: Storage format changed but summarization didn't update
5. **LLM guidance matters**: Explicit anti-hallucination warnings help when memory is empty
6. **Continuity vs accuracy tradeoff**: Including bot responses helps continuity but risks feedback loops

## Related Issues

- Conversation history: `src/core/message_processor.py` conversation cache integration
- CDL character system: Jake's poetic personality makes hallucinations more semantic-match prone

## Future Considerations

1. **Intent detection**: Distinguish "show me topics" from "continue conversation" queries
2. **Source filtering**: Option to prioritize `user_message` entries for memory recall queries
3. **Conversation summarization**: LLM-based summarization for older conversations (>2 hours)
4. **Memory metrics**: Track memory context size and quality over time
5. **Character-specific tuning**: Adjust limits based on character communication style

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Core truncation bugs fixed, system working as designed with documented tradeoffs
