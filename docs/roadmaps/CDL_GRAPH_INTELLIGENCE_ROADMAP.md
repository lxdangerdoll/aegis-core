# CDL Graph Intelligence - Implementation Roadmap

**Created**: October 8, 2025  
**Updated**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: STEPS 1-3 ✅ VALIDATED OPERATIONAL | STEP 4 ⚠️ SUPERSEDED | STEP 5+ 📋 FUTURE

**✅ VALIDATION STATUS**: All core systems confirmed working through direct database testing (October 9, 2025)

**⚠️ NOTE**: This roadmap has been partially superseded by `MEMORY_INTELLIGENCE_CONVERGENCE_ROADMAP.md` which takes a simpler, pure-integration approach for emotional features.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Enhance CDL character knowledge with PostgreSQL graph intelligen### ⚠️ **STEP 4: Emotional Context Synchronization** (SUPERSEDED)

**⚠️ SUPERSEDED BY MEMORY INTELLIGENCE CONVERGENCE APPROACH**

This step has been superseded by the Memory Intelligence Convergence roadmap (`MEMORY_INTELLIGENCE_CONVERGENCE_ROADMAP.md`) which takes a simpler approach:
- **Instead of**: New `get_emotionally_resonant_memories()` method in CharacterGraphManager
- **Use**: Existing RoBERTa emotion analysis data already stored in Qdrant vector memories
- **Rationale**: "Pure integration approach - NO new storage systems, maximum intelligence reuse"
- **Implementation**: PHASE 1 of Memory Intelligence Convergence roadmap leverages existing emotional metadata

**Original Implementation (DEPRECATED)**:e, creating richer, more contextually-aware character responses.

**Architecture**: Build on existing WhisperEngine graph infrastructure (SemanticKnowledgeRouter for user facts) and extend to character personal knowledge (CharacterGraphManager).

**Design Philosophy**: 
- ✅ Keep it simple first, enhance progressively
- ✅ Personality-first - graph supports authenticity, doesn't override it
- ✅ No "Phase" or "Sprint" terminology - use clear STEP numbering

**Goal**: Link user emotional patterns to character memories for authentic empathy

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/characters/cdl/character_graph_manager.py` - Add `get_emotionally_resonant_memories()`

**Changes**:
```python
async def get_emotionally_resonant_memories(
    self,
    character_name: str,
    user_emotional_context: str,  # From user facts: "stressed", "happy", "anxious"
    emotional_intensity: float  # From current message analysis
) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Find character memories that emotionally resonate with user state.
    
    User stressed about work → Character's work stress memories
    User excited about achievement → Character's success memories
    User grieving → Character's loss/grief memories
    """
    
    # Map user emotions to character memory emotional_impact
    emotion_mapping = {
        "stressed": ["overwhelmed", "pressure", "deadline"],
        "happy": ["joy", "success", "achievement"],
        "anxious": ["nervous", "worried", "uncertain"],

        SELECT title, description, emotional_impact
        FROM character_memories
        WHERE character_id = $1
          AND emotional_impact >= $2  -- Match intensity threshold
          AND (
              description ILIKE ANY($3::TEXT[])  -- Emotion keywords
              OR emotional_context = $4
          )
        ORDER BY emotional_impact DESC
        LIMIT 3
    """
```

**Use Cases**:
- User: "Work has been really stressful" → Elena shares overwhelming deadline memory

## 🔧 **CRITICAL: Environment Configuration Required**

**Status**: ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE CONFIGURATION NEEDED

**Issue Identified**: All intelligence systems are implemented and functional, but live bot containers are missing database environment variables.

**Root Cause**: 
- ✅ All sophisticated systems confirmed working through direct testing
- ✅ Database connectivity stable (PostgreSQL port 5433)
- ❌ Live bot containers missing PostgreSQL credentials

**Required Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Add to all bot .env files (.env.elena, .env.marcus, etc.)
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5433
POSTGRES_USER=whisperengine
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=whisperengine_password
POSTGRES_DB=whisperengine
```

**Action Items**:
1. ✅ Add database credentials to bot environment files
2. ✅ Restart bot containers to load new environment
3. ✅ Test live bot intelligence features
4. ✅ Validate operational status in production

**Expected Outcome**: All implemented intelligence systems will become active in live bots once environment configuration is completed.

### 🎯 **STEP 5: Proactive Context Injection** (NEXT PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Characters proactively inject relevant knowledge when user mentions topics

**Files to Create**:
- `src/characters/cdl/character_context_enhancer.py` - New class

**Architecture**:
```python
class CharacterContextEnhancer:
    """
    Detects topics in user messages and proactively injects 
    relevant character knowledge into system prompt.
    """
    
    async def detect_and_inject_context(
        self,
        user_message: str,
        character_name: str,
        base_system_prompt: str
    ) -> str:
        """
        1. Extract topics/entities from user message (diving, photography, etc.)
        2. Query CharacterGraphManager for matching background/abilities
        3. Calculate relevance scores
        4. Inject high-relevance context into system prompt
        
        Example:
        User mentions "diving" → Elena's diving research auto-injected
        User mentions "photography" → Jake's photo expertise auto-injected
        """
```

**Use Cases**:
- User mentions "diving" → Elena's background injected: "You're a marine biologist who researches coral reefs through diving"
- User mentions "photography" → Jake's expertise injected: "You're an adventure photographer with 15 years experience"
- User mentions "AI ethics" → Marcus's research injected: "You research AI safety and alignment"

**Expected Outcome**:
```
User: "I'm thinking about getting into underwater photography"
Elena: *diving + research background auto-injected into context*
"That's exciting! Underwater photography is how I document much of my research. 
The challenges are unique - you need to understand marine behavior, lighting in 
water, and equipment maintenance. I use a Canon in an Ikelite housing for my 
coral documentation. What draws you to underwater photography specifically?"
```

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours  
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Powerful but complex  
**Dependencies**: Steps 1-4 complete

---

### 🎚️ **STEP 6: Confidence-Aware Conversations**

**Goal**: Characters use confidence scores from user facts for conversational nuance

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py` - Enhance prompt building with confidence levels

**Changes**:
```python
async def build_confidence_aware_context(
    self,
    user_facts: List[Dict],
    confidence_threshold_high: float = 0.9,
    confidence_threshold_medium: float = 0.6
) -> str:
    """
    Format user facts with confidence-aware language:
    
    High confidence (0.9+): "The user loves pizza"
    Medium confidence (0.6-0.8): "The user mentioned liking pizza"
    Low confidence (<0.6): "The user may like pizza (unconfirmed)"
    """
    
    context_parts = []
    for fact in user_facts:
        confidence = fact['confidence']
        entity = fact['entity_name']
        
        if confidence >= confidence_threshold_high:
            context_parts.append(f"The user loves {entity} (high confidence)")
        elif confidence >= confidence_threshold_medium:
            context_parts.append(f"The user mentioned {entity} (medium confidence)")
        else:
            context_parts.append(f"The user may like {entity} (unconfirmed)")
```

**Use Cases**:
- High confidence: "I know you love pizza!" (mentioned 5+ times)
- Medium confidence: "I think you mentioned liking Thai food?" (mentioned once)
- Low confidence: "Do you like sushi?" (casual mention, unsure)

**Expected Outcome**:
```
User: "What should I eat for dinner?"
Elena: "Well, I know you love Italian food - pizza and pasta are your go-tos! 
I think you mentioned liking Thai food too, though I'm not as sure about that. 
Have you tried the new Thai place downtown?"
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Polish feature  
**Dependencies**: Step 2 complete (cross-pollination)

---

### ❓ **STEP 7: Intelligent Question Generation**

**Goal**: Characters ask follow-up questions based on knowledge gaps

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py` - Add gap analysis and question generation

**Changes**:
```python
async def generate_curiosity_questions(
    self,
    user_id: str,
    character_name: str,
    semantic_router
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Analyze user facts for knowledge gaps and generate natural questions.
    
    Known: User loves marine biology (confidence 0.9)
    Unknown: How they learned about it, what aspect interests them
    Generate: "How did you get interested in marine biology?"
    """
    
    # Get high-confidence facts
    facts = await semantic_router.get_user_facts(user_id, limit=50)
    high_confidence_facts = [f for f in facts if f['confidence'] > 0.8]
    
    # For each fact, check for missing context
    gap_questions = []
    for fact in high_confidence_facts:
        entity = fact['entity_name']
        
        # Check if we know HOW they got interested
        origin_facts = [f for f in facts if 'learned' in f.get('relationship_type', '')]
        if not origin_facts:
            gap_questions.append(f"How did you get interested in {entity}?")
```

**Use Cases**:
- Known: User loves diving (0.9) → Unknown: Where they dive → "Where do you usually dive?"
- Known: User reads sci-fi (0.85) → Unknown: Favorite authors → "Who are your favorite sci-fi authors?"
- Known: User plays guitar (0.9) → Unknown: How long → "How long have you been playing guitar?"

**Expected Outcome**:
```
Elena: "I can tell you're really into marine biology - you light up when we 
discuss it! How did you first get interested in the ocean? Was it a childhood 
experience, or something that came later?"
```

**Estimated Time**: 5-6 hours  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Adds conversational depth  
**Dependencies**: Steps 2 & 6 complete

---

### 🚀 **STEP 8: Database Performance Indexes**

**Goal**: Optimize graph query performance to sub-millisecond response times

**Files to Create**:
- `database/migrations/add_character_graph_indexes.sql`

**SQL Changes**:
```sql
-- GIN index for trigger array overlap queries
CREATE INDEX idx_character_memories_triggers 
ON character_memories USING GIN(triggers);

-- Trigram indexes for text similarity search
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_character_background_description_trgm 
ON character_background USING GIN(description gin_trgm_ops);

-- Indexes for importance/strength/proficiency sorting
CREATE INDEX idx_character_background_importance 
ON character_background(character_id, importance_level DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_character_relationships_strength 
ON character_relationships(character_id, relationship_strength DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_character_abilities_proficiency 
ON character_abilities(character_id, proficiency_level DESC);

-- Composite index for filtered queries
CREATE INDEX idx_character_background_category_importance 
ON character_background(character_id, category, importance_level DESC);
```

**Performance Goals**:
- Background queries: <10ms
- Memory trigger queries: <15ms (GIN array overlap)
- Relationship queries: <10ms
- Ability queries: <10ms
- Overall graph query: <50ms total

**Testing**:
```bash
# Before indexes
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM character_memories WHERE triggers && ARRAY['diving'];
# Seq Scan: 120ms

# After GIN index
# Index Scan: 2ms
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Performance optimization  
**Dependencies**: Step 1 complete (queries under load)

---

## 🔮 Optional Enhancements

### **OPTIONAL A: Multi-Character Knowledge Synthesis**

**Goal**: Correlate facts across characters for holistic user understanding

**Privacy Considerations**:
- Requires explicit user consent
- Toggle per character: "Allow Elena to know what I discuss with Jake"
- Default: OFF (strict privacy)

**Use Cases**:
- Elena knows user loves diving + Jake knows user loves photography → "underwater photographer"
- Marcus knows tech discussions + Sophia knows marketing → "works in tech marketing"

**Complexity**: HIGH - Privacy-sensitive feature  
**Priority**: LOW - Powerful but requires careful implementation

---

### **OPTIONAL B: Temporal Intelligence**

**Goal**: Track when character knowledge developed and evolved

**Schema Changes**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE character_background ADD COLUMN knowledge_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE character_memories ADD COLUMN memory_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE character_relationships ADD COLUMN relationship_start_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE character_abilities ADD COLUMN skill_acquired_date DATE;
```

**Use Cases**:
- "I've been researching coral reefs for 5 years, since 2020"
- "I learned underwater photography in 2022"
- "I've known Dr. Rodriguez for 10 years"

**Complexity**: LOW-MEDIUM - Schema changes + query updates  
**Priority**: LOW - Adds depth but not critical

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Query Performance**: <50ms for full character graph query
- **Cross-reference Hit Rate**: % of user questions that find character-user overlaps
- **Memory Activation Rate**: % of memories triggered by user facts vs keywords
- **Emotional Resonance**: % of responses matching user emotional context

### Qualitative
- **"She just gets me" moments**: Proactive memory sharing feels natural
- **Conversational depth**: Back-and-forth dialogue vs Q&A pattern
- **Emotional authenticity**: Empathy responses feel genuine
- **Knowledge richness**: Responses show deep character understanding

Elena: "I enjoy reading marine biology books and scientific literature."
(Generic, no connection to user context)
```

### User Experience After (All Steps)
```
User: "Elena, have you read any books I mentioned?"
Elena: "You mentioned 'The Soul of an Octopus' - I haven't read it yet, but 
it sounds fascinating and relates directly to my cephalopod intelligence research! 
I did read 'The Hidden Life of Trees' which you also mentioned. The interconnected 
communication systems reminded me of coral reef ecosystems I study. Have you read 
'Lab Girl' by Hope Jahren? Based on your love of nature writing, I think you'd 
really enjoy it."

Features demonstrated:
✅ Cross-pollination (knows user's books)
✅ Character knowledge (cephalopod research)
