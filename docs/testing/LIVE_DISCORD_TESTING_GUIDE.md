## 🔍 Log Validation Commands

### Check CDL Component Loading
```bash
# Check if all CDL components are being added
docker logs elena-bot 2>&1 | grep "STRUCTURED CONTEXT: Added CDL" | tail -20

# Expected output (per message):
# ✅ STRUCTURED CONTEXT: Added CDL character identity for elena
# ✅ STRUCTURED CONTEXT: Added CDL character mode for elena
# ✅ STRUCTURED CONTEXT: Added CDL temporal awareness
# (AI_IDENTITY_GUIDANCE only appears when user asks about AI)
```

### Check Assembly Metrics
```bash
# Check token usage and component counts
docker logs elena-bot 2>&1 | grep "STRUCTURED ASSEMBLY METRICS" -A 4 | tail -20

# Expected output:
# 📊 STRUCTURED ASSEMBLY METRICS:
#   - Components: 7-10
#   - Tokens: 400-600
#   - Characters: 1600-2400
#   - Within budget: True
```

### Check for Errors
```bash
# Look for any CDL-related errors
docker logs elena-bot 2>&1 | grep -E "ERROR.*CDL|WARNING.*CDL" | tail -10

# Should see graceful warnings for missing components:
# ⚠️  STRUCTURED CONTEXT: No character backstory found (expected)
# ⚠️  STRUCTURED CONTEXT: No character principles found (expected)
```

### Monitor Recent Activity
```bash
# See latest message processing
docker logs elena-bot 2>&1 | tail -50
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

### **Must Pass**:
- [ ] Bot responds to all test messages without errors
- [ ] Character personality matches Elena's established traits
- [ ] AI identity handling works correctly (honest but in-character)
- [ ] Temporal awareness shows correct date/time
- [ ] Logs show "✅ STRUCTURED CONTEXT: Added CDL" messages
- [ ] Assembly metrics show components within token budget
- [ ] No breaking errors in logs

### **Expected Graceful Failures**:
- [ ] Log warnings for CHARACTER_BACKSTORY (missing database field) - OK
- [ ] Log warnings for CHARACTER_PRINCIPLES (missing database field) - OK
- [ ] Log warnings for USER_PERSONALITY (missing method) - OK
- [ ] Log warnings for CHARACTER_RELATIONSHIPS (missing method) - OK

### **Performance Targets**:
- [ ] Token usage: < 5% of 20K budget (~1000 tokens)
- [ ] Assembly time: Should see prompt assembly logs
- [ ] Response quality: Natural, in-character responses

## 📊 Expected Component Breakdown

For a typical message with AI keyword:
```
Component 1: CHARACTER_IDENTITY (362 chars)
Component 2: CHARACTER_MODE (157 chars)
Component 5: AI_IDENTITY_GUIDANCE (243 chars) - conditional
Component 6: TEMPORAL_AWARENESS (96 chars)
Component 8: CHARACTER_PERSONALITY (394 chars)
Component 10: CHARACTER_VOICE (415 chars)
Component 16: KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT (161 chars)

Total: ~1,828 chars (~457 tokens = 2.3% of budget)
```

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

### **Critical Issues** (Stop Testing):
- Bot crashes or becomes unresponsive
- Errors in message processing
- Character personality completely changes
- Responses are incoherent or broken

### **Minor Issues** (Note and Continue):
- Missing optional components (backstory, principles, etc.)
- Slight personality variations
- Token usage slightly higher than expected
