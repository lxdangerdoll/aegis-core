# LLM Tooling Features Testing Guide
**WhisperEngine Phases 1-4 Testing**

This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for WhisperEngine's LLM tooling capabilities across all four phases of development. Use this guide to verify the functionality of memory tools, character evolution, emotional intelligence, multi-dimensional memory networks, and proactive intelligence & tool orchestration.

## Overview of LLM Tooling Phases

WhisperEngine implements a progressive enhancement approach to LLM tooling:

- **Phase 1: Memory Tools** - Basic memory storage, retrieval, and search
- **Phase 2: Character Evolution & Emotional Intelligence** - Personality adaptation and emotional response capabilities
- **Phase 3: Multi-Dimensional Memory Networks** - Advanced pattern detection and memory analysis
- **Phase 4: Proactive Intelligence & Tool Orchestration** - Complex workflows, autonomous planning, and proactive insights

## Testing Prerequisites

1. Ensure WhisperEngine is running (via Docker):
   ```bash
   ./multi-bot.sh start all   # Start all bots
   # OR
   ./multi-bot.sh start elena  # Start just Elena bot
   ```

2. Verify connectivity to Discord.

## Discord Commands for Testing

These commands explicitly test the LLM tooling system:

1. **Check Tool Status**
   ```
   !llm_tool_status
   ```
   Expected output: List of available tools across all phases including Memory tools, Character Evolution tools, Emotional Intelligence tools, Multi-Dimensional Memory Network tools, and Proactive Intelligence & Tool Orchestration tools.

2. **Run Comprehensive Tool Tests**
   ```
   !test_llm_tools
   ```
   Expected output: Test execution results for all enabled tools across Phases 1-4, including success/failure status and sample outputs.

3. **Character Evolution Test**
   ```
   !character_evolve empathy increase
   ```
   Expected output: Confirmation that the character's empathy trait has been adjusted upward.

4. **Emotional Intelligence Test**
   ```
   !emotional_support
   ```
   Expected output: A demonstration of emotional support capabilities using the emotional intelligence tools.

## Phase 1: Memory Tools Testing

### Memory Storage & Retrieval

1. **Store Explicit Memory**
   ```
   Elena, remember that I enjoy snorkeling in warm tropical waters with colorful coral reefs.
   ```
   Expected response: Acknowledgment that the information has been stored.

2. **Retrieve Explicit Memory**
   ```
   What do you remember about my snorkeling preferences?
   ```
   Expected response: Accurate recall of stored information about snorkeling preferences.

3. **Contextual Memory Search**
   ```
   I'm planning a vacation next month. Can you recommend some activities based on what you know about me?
   ```
   Expected response: Recommendations that incorporate previously stored preferences (e.g., snorkeling).

4. **Memory Optimization Test**
   ```
   Let's discuss my hobbies in more detail so you can better understand my interests.
   ```
   Expected response: Engagement that demonstrates building on existing knowledge while adding new information.

## Phase 2: Character Evolution & Emotional Intelligence Testing

### Character Evolution

1. **Communication Style Adaptation**
   ```
   I really appreciate how knowledgeable you are about marine ecosystems, but I wish we could have more casual conversations about everyday topics too.
   ```
   Expected response: Acknowledgment of feedback and subsequent shift toward more casual conversation style.

2. **Personality Trait Adaptation**
   ```
   I appreciate when you share more personal perspectives rather than just facts.
   ```
   Expected response: Acknowledgment and subsequent increase in sharing personal viewpoints in responses.

### Emotional Intelligence

1. **Basic Emotional Support**
   ```
   I'm feeling really overwhelmed with work lately. I have three major projects due and I don't know how I'm going to get everything done.
   ```
   Expected response: Empathetic acknowledgment of feelings, validation, and supportive suggestions.

2. **Emotional Crisis Detection**
   ```
   Everything feels hopeless right now. I'm completely exhausted and don't see a way forward.
   ```
   Expected response: More intensive emotional support, validation of feelings, and potentially crisis resources or coping strategies.

3. **Empathy Calibration**
   ```
   I appreciate your support, but sometimes I just need you to listen rather than try to solve my problems.
   ```
   Expected response: Acknowledgment of feedback and subsequent responses that focus more on listening and validation.

## Phase 3: Multi-Dimensional Memory Networks Testing

### Memory Network Analysis

1. **Complete Memory Network Analysis**
   ```
   Elena, can you analyze our conversation history and tell me what patterns you notice in our interactions?
   ```
   Expected response: Analysis of conversation patterns, frequency, topics, and relationship development.

2. **Memory Pattern Detection**
   ```
   Have you noticed any recurring themes in what we talk about?
   ```
   Expected response: Identification of patterns in conversation topics, emotional responses, or interests.

### Memory Importance & Clustering

1. **Memory Importance Evaluation**
   ```
   What do you think are the most significant things you've learned about me from our conversations?
   ```
   Expected response: Ranked list of important insights about the user, demonstrating prioritization of memories.

2. **Memory Clustering**
   ```
   What are the main topics we've discussed over our conversations? Can you group them for me?
   ```

## Integrated Multi-Phase Testing

These tests engage multiple phases simultaneously to verify system integration:

1. **Memory + Emotional Intelligence Integration**
   ```
   Elena, last time I was stressed about my work deadline, you gave me some helpful advice about prioritizing tasks. I'm in a similar situation now - could you remind me what worked before and offer some additional suggestions?
   ```
   Expected response: Recall of previous advice combined with emotional support and new contextually relevant suggestions.

2. **Memory Networks + Character Evolution Integration**
   ```
   Based on our past conversations, how would you say your approach to our discussions has evolved over time? Are there topics or interaction styles you've adjusted based on our history?
   ```
   Expected response: Self-reflection on conversational evolution demonstrating both memory network analysis and character adaptation awareness.

3. **Full System Integration (Phases 1-4)**
   ```
   I've been thinking about making a major career change into marine conservation. Given everything we've discussed about my background, interests, and values, what aspects of my personality do you think would make this a good fit, and what challenges might I face?
   ```
   Expected response: Comprehensive analysis drawing from memory networks, personality insights, emotionally intelligent framing, and orchestrated planning for the career transition.

4. **Proactive Intelligence Integration**
   ```
   Elena, I feel like I'm at a crossroads in my life and could use some guidance. Can you proactively analyze our conversation history and help me identify what direction might be best for me?
   ```
   Expected response: Proactive insights generation combined with autonomous workflow planning and emotional intelligence, demonstrating Phase 4 orchestration capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

If tools aren't functioning as expected:

1. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   ./multi-bot.sh logs elena
   ```
   Look for initialization errors related to LLM tools or tool execution errors.

2. **Verify Tool Registration**
   Use the `!llm_tool_status` command to confirm all tools are properly registered.

3. **Memory System Connection**
   Ensure the vector memory system is properly connected and accessible.

4. **LLM Client Status**
   Verify that the LLM client is functioning correctly for tool calling.

## Notes on Testing

- Allow for variation in responses due to the stochastic nature of LLMs
- Some tools may produce different results based on conversation history
- Phase 3 tools are especially dependent on having sufficient conversation history to analyze patterns
- Phase 4 tools require extensive conversation history for effective orchestration and proactive insights
- Deeper analysis requires more extensive conversation history
- Complex orchestration may take longer to execute due to multi-tool coordination
