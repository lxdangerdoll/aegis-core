## Testing Infrastructure Ready for Use

### Docker-Based Testing
```bash
# Run enhanced synthetic testing with character intelligence validation
docker-compose -f docker-compose.synthetic.yml up

# Run specific character intelligence testing service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.synthetic.yml up character-intelligence-tester

# Run direct character intelligence testing (preferred method)
docker exec synthetic-character-intelligence-tester python direct_character_intelligence_tester.py
```

### Direct Testing (Alternative)
```bash
# Set up environment for direct testing
export FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH="/tmp/fastembed_cache"
export QDRANT_HOST="localhost" 
export QDRANT_PORT="6334"
export POSTGRES_HOST="localhost"
export POSTGRES_PORT="5433"

# Run direct character intelligence validation
source .venv/bin/activate
python direct_character_intelligence_tester.py

# Run synthetic character intelligence validation  
python character_intelligence_synthetic_validator.py
```

## Validation Metrics Collected

### Character Intelligence System Metrics
- **CharacterGraphManager effectiveness**: Relationship management and knowledge access
