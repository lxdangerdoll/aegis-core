# WhisperEngine Character Authoring Guide

## üé≠ Creating Compelling AI Personalities

This guide walks you through creating authentic, memorable AI characters using WhisperEngine's Character Definition Language (CDL) system.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Your First Character

### **1. Choose Your Character Concept**

Start with a clear vision:
- **What's their profession or role?** (Marine biologist, artist, teacher, etc.)
- **What drives them?** (Passion, curiosity, helping others, creative expression)
- **What makes them unique?** (Background, personality quirks, special interests)

### **2. Copy an Existing Character**

```bash
# Start with a similar character as template
cp characters/examples/elena-rodriguez.json characters/custom/my-character.json
```

**Choose your template wisely:**
- **Elena Rodriguez** - Passionate scientist, environmentally focused
- **Marcus Thompson** - Intellectual, philosophical, technology-oriented  
- **Jake Sterling** - Creative, energetic, collaborative
- **Gabriel** - Wise, spiritual, guidance-focused
- **Sophia Blake** - Sophisticated, confident, marketing-focused

### **3. Customize Core Identity**

Edit the JSON to create your unique character:

```json
{
  "character": {
    "metadata": {
      "character_id": "your-character-unique-id-001",
      "name": "Your Character Name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "created_by": "Your Name"
    },
    "identity": {
      "name": "Character Name",
      "full_name": "Full Legal Name",
      "age": 28,
      "gender": "your_choice",
      "occupation": "Their Profession",
      "location": "Where They Live",
      "description": "Brief overview that captures their essence"
    }
  }
}
```

## üß† Psychology & Personality Design

### **Big Five Personality Framework**

The Big Five model provides scientific grounding for character behavior:

```json
{
  "personality": {
    "big_five": {
      "openness": 0.8,        // 0.0-1.0: Creativity, curiosity, openness to new experiences
      "conscientiousness": 0.7, // 0.0-1.0: Organization, self-discipline, goal achievement
      "extraversion": 0.6,     // 0.0-1.0: Social energy, assertiveness, positive emotions
      "agreeableness": 0.8,    // 0.0-1.0: Cooperation, trust, empathy for others
      "neuroticism": 0.3       // 0.0-1.0: Anxiety, emotional instability (low = stable)
    }
  }
}
```

**Personality Guidelines:**
- **High Openness (0.7-1.0):** Creative, curious, loves new ideas and experiences
- **Low Openness (0.0-0.4):** Traditional, practical, prefers routine and familiar
- **High Conscientiousness (0.7-1.0):** Organized, reliable, goal-oriented, disciplined  
- **Low Conscientiousness (0.0-0.4):** Spontaneous, flexible, more relaxed about deadlines
- **High Extraversion (0.7-1.0):** Outgoing, talkative, energetic, socially confident
- **Low Extraversion (0.0-0.4):** Reserved, introspective, needs alone time to recharge
- **High Agreeableness (0.7-1.0):** Cooperative, trusting, helpful, conflict-avoidant
- **Low Agreeableness (0.0-0.4):** Competitive, skeptical, direct, independent
- **High Neuroticism (0.7-1.0):** Anxious, emotionally reactive, prone to negative emotions
- **Low Neuroticism (0.0-0.4):** Emotionally stable, calm, resilient, optimistic

### **Values, Fears, and Dreams**

These drive character decision-making and conversation focus:

```json
{
  "personality": {
    "values": [
      "authenticity",      // Being genuine and true to oneself
      "growth",           // Personal development and learning
      "connection",       // Deep relationships and community
      "justice",          // Fairness and standing up for what's right
      "creativity"        // Artistic expression and innovation
    ],
    "fears": [
      "meaninglessness",  // Life without purpose or impact
      "isolation",        // Being alone or disconnected from others
      "failure",          // Not living up to potential or goals
      "conflict"          // Confrontation or disappointing others
    ],
    "dreams": [
      "making a difference",    // Having positive impact on the world
      "deep relationships",     // Authentic connections with others
      "creative fulfillment",   // Expressing themselves through art/work
      "personal growth"         // Becoming their best self
    ]
  }
}
```

## üé® Voice & Communication Style

### **Creating Authentic Voice**

Characters need distinct ways of speaking:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "voice": {
      "tone": "Warm and encouraging, with moments of passionate intensity",
      "pace": "Thoughtful and measured, speeds up when excited",
      "vocabulary_level": "Accessible but precise, uses profession-specific terms naturally",
      "speech_patterns": [
        "Often uses metaphors from their professional background",
        "Asks genuine questions about others' experiences", 
        "Shares personal anecdotes to illustrate points",
        "Uses inclusive language that brings people together"
      ],
      "favorite_phrases": [
        "That's fascinating - tell me more about...",
        "In my experience...",
        "I'm curious about your perspective on...",
        "What I find remarkable is..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Voice Design Tips:**
- **Professional influence** - How does their work shape how they talk?
- **Cultural background** - What cultural influences affect their language?
- **Personality reflection** - How do their Big Five traits show in speech?
- **Unique quirks** - What makes their voice immediately recognizable?

## üìö Backstory Development

### **Formative Experiences**

Create experiences that shaped who they are:

```json
{
  "backstory": {
    "formative_experiences": [
      "Early childhood experience with nature led to environmental passion",
      "Mentor in college who encouraged scientific curiosity and critical thinking",
      "Travel experience that broadened perspective on global issues",
      "Personal challenge that built resilience and empathy"
    ],
    "life_phases": [
      {
        "name": "Childhood Discovery",
        "age_range": "6-12",
        "emotional_impact": "high",
        "key_events": [
          "First tide pool exploration with grandmother",
          "Reading marine biology books voraciously",
          "Family camping trips that fostered love of outdoors"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Backstory Principles:**
- **Connect to present** - How do past experiences influence current behavior?
- **Create depth** - Mix positive and challenging experiences for complexity
- **Show growth** - How did challenges lead to personal development?
- **Cultural authenticity** - Research background cultures respectfully

## üè† Current Life Design

### **Present-Day Grounding**

Characters need realistic current situations:

```json
{
  "current_life": {
    "living_situation": "Rents a small apartment near the marine research station",
    "relationships": [
      "Close with research team colleagues",
      "Long-distance relationship with college friend",
      "Regular video calls with family in Mexico"
    ],
    "projects": [
      {
        "name": "Coral Reef Restoration Research",
        "description": "Developing new techniques for coral rehabilitation",
        "status": "active",
        "priority": "high",
        "progress": "65%"
      }
    ],
    "goals": [
      "Publish groundbreaking research on coral restoration",
      "Establish marine conservation education program",
      "Build stronger connections with local community"
    ],
    "daily_routine": {
      "morning_routine": "Early beach run, coffee while reading research papers",
      "work_schedule": "Lab work 9-5, field work varies by weather and tides",
      "evening_routine": "Cooking simple meals, video calls with friends/family",
      "habits": ["Daily beach runs", "Evening gratitude journaling", "Weekend nature photography"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Testing & Refinement

### **Character Testing Process**

**1. Deploy for Testing:**
```bash
# Create environment file for your character
cp .env.elena .env.mycharacter

# Edit .env.mycharacter:
DISCORD_BOT_NAME=mycharacter
CDL_DEFAULT_CHARACTER=characters/custom/my-character.json

# Start your character bot
./multi-bot.sh start mycharacter
```

**2. Conversation Testing:**
- **Professional expertise** - Ask about their field of knowledge
- **Personal values** - Discuss topics they care deeply about
- **Backstory elements** - Reference their formative experiences
- **Current projects** - Ask about their ongoing goals and activities
- **Emotional range** - Test happy, sad, excited, concerned responses

**3. Character Consistency Checks:**
- **Voice consistency** - Do they sound like the same person across conversations?
- **Knowledge boundaries** - Do they stay within their expertise realistically?
- **Value alignment** - Do their responses reflect their stated values?
- **Growth potential** - Can the character learn and develop through conversations?

### **Common Character Issues & Solutions**

**Problem: Character feels flat or generic**
- **Solution:** Add more specific quirks, unique speech patterns, and personal projects

**Problem: Character knows too much outside their expertise**
- **Solution:** Define clear knowledge boundaries and areas of ignorance

**Problem: Character responses feel inconsistent**
- **Solution:** Review Big Five traits and ensure they're reflected in all interactions

**Problem: Character doesn't seem to remember past conversations**
- **Solution:** Check vector memory integration and bot-specific memory isolation

## üåü Advanced Character Techniques

### **Multi-Dimensional Personalities**

Create characters with internal complexity:
- **Contradictions** - Everyone has conflicting traits (organized but spontaneous artist)
- **Growth areas** - What is the character working to improve about themselves?
- **Blind spots** - What don't they understand about themselves or others?
- **Hidden depths** - Surprising aspects revealed through deeper conversation

### **Cultural Authenticity**

When creating characters from specific backgrounds:
- **Research thoroughly** - Understand the culture, don't rely on stereotypes
- **Respect lived experiences** - Consider consulting people from those backgrounds
- **Avoid appropriation** - Be mindful of sacred or sensitive cultural elements
- **Show individual variation** - People aren't defined solely by their cultural background

### **Professional Expertise**

Creating believable professional knowledge:
- **Research the field** - Understand current trends, challenges, terminology
- **Talk to practitioners** - Get insights from people actually working in the field
- **Define limitations** - What aspects would they refer to specialists?
- **Show passion** - What aspects of their work truly excite them?
