# Character Definition Language (CDL) Specification v1.0

## Overview

The Character Definition Language (CDL) is WhisperEngine's comprehensive JSON-based format for defining AI character personalities, backgrounds, and behavioral traits. CDL creates authentic, memorable AI companions with persistent memory and relationship capabilities.

## ðŸŽ­ CDL Philosophy

CDL is designed to create characters that:
- **Feel authentic** through psychologically grounded personality systems
- **Build relationships** via persistent vector memory integration
- **Maintain consistency** across conversations and platforms
- **Support creativity** without corporate AI platform limitations
- **Respect diversity** through inclusive character design principles

## ðŸš€ Deployment Integration

CDL characters integrate with WhisperEngine's multi-bot architecture:

### **Multi-Bot Deployment**
Each character runs as a dedicated bot with isolated memory:
```bash
# Dedicated character bots with persistent relationships
./multi-bot.sh start elena    # Elena Rodriguez (marine biologist)  
./multi-bot.sh start marcus   # Marcus Thompson (AI researcher)
./multi-bot.sh start gabriel  # Gabriel
```

### **Single-Bot Character Switching**  
One bot instance can host multiple character personalities:
```bash
# Switch between characters in conversations
!roleplay elena
!roleplay marcus
!roleplay off
```

## ðŸ“‹ Format Specification

CDL files use **JSON format** (`.json` extension) for optimal parsing reliability and integration with WhisperEngine's AI pipeline.

### **Complete Integration Stack:**
- **ðŸŽ­ Personality System** - Big Five psychology model + custom traits
- **ðŸ’¾ Vector Memory** - Qdrant database with FastEmbed for semantic relationship tracking  
- **ðŸ§  Emotional Intelligence** - Enhanced emotion analysis adapts character responses
- **ðŸ‘¥ Universal Identity** - Cross-platform user relationships (Discord, web, future)
- **ðŸ”’ Memory Isolation** - Bot-specific memory prevents character personality bleed
- **âš¡ Dynamic Loading** - Characters cached for performance with hot-reload support

### **File Structure**

```json

  "cdl_version": "1.0",

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Character Creation

1. Start with a clear character concept
2. Define core identity elements first
3. Build personality from psychological research
4. Create consistent backstory
5. Ground character in current reality

### 2. File Naming

Use descriptive filenames with character name and identifier:
- `elena-rodriguez.json`
- `marcus-chen.json`
- `character-name-role.json`

### 3. Validation

Characters should be validated for:
- Required fields present
- Logical consistency
- Realistic personality combinations
- Complete character arcs

### 4. Integration

CDL characters integrate with AI systems through:
- Prompt generation
- Context injection
- Memory enhancement
- Behavioral modeling

## Example Character

See `examples/elena-rodriguez.json` for a complete character definition following this specification.

## ðŸ¤– AI Pipeline Integration

### **Character-Aware Prompt Generation**
CDL characters automatically generate contextual prompts:
```python
# Character traits influence conversation prompts
from src.prompts.cdl_ai_integration import CDLAIPromptIntegration

cdl_integration = CDLAIPromptIntegration(memory_manager)
system_prompt = await cdl_integration.create_character_aware_prompt(
    character_file='characters/examples/elena-rodriguez.json',
    user_id=user_id,
    message_content=message,
    pipeline_result=emotion_analysis
)
```

### **Vector Memory Integration**
Characters maintain persistent relationships through vector memory:
- **Semantic memory** - Qdrant + FastEmbed for conversation context
- **Emotional context** - Enhanced emotion analysis stored with memories
- **Bot-specific isolation** - Each character has separate memory space
- **Cross-platform continuity** - Memories persist across Discord, web interface

### **Personality-Driven Behavior**
Big Five traits influence AI responses:
- **High Openness** â†’ More creative, curious responses
- **High Conscientiousness** â†’ More organized, goal-focused interactions  
- **High Extraversion** â†’ More energetic, socially engaging responses
- **High Agreeableness** â†’ More cooperative, empathetic interactions
- **Low Neuroticism** â†’ More emotionally stable, optimistic responses

### **Dynamic Character Features**
- **Project tracking** - Characters discuss and work toward their defined goals
- **Relationship evolution** - Characters develop deeper connections over time  
- **Cultural authenticity** - Background influences perspective and knowledge
- **Professional expertise** - Occupation shapes conversation domains and insights
- **Memory-triggered moments** - Past conversations influence future interactions

## ðŸ”„ Character Lifecycle Management

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Create JSON file** following CDL specification
2. **Test character** using single-bot or dedicated deployment  
3. **Iterate personality** based on conversation testing
4. **Deploy production** as dedicated bot with persistent memory
5. **Monitor performance** and refine character traits over time

### **Version Control**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",    // Semantic versioning for character evolution
    "created_date": "2025-09-17T20:00:00Z",
    "modified_date": "2025-09-27T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### **Character Portability**
- **Complete self-contained** - Single JSON file contains entire personality
- **Cross-platform** - Works across Discord, web interface, future integrations  
- **Shareable** - Easy to distribute and collaborate on character development
- **Version controllable** - Track character evolution through git or similar

## ðŸš€ Future Considerations

- **Multi-character interactions** - Characters that know about each other

- **Dynamic trait evolution** - Personality changes through extended interaction
- **Advanced memory systems** - Hierarchical memory with short/medium/long-term storage
- **Character validation tools** - Automated consistency and realism checking
- **Community character sharing** - Marketplace for character definitions
- **Specialized character types** - Domain-specific character templates (educator, therapist, creative partner)
