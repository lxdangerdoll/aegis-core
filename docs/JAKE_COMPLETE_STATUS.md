## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Task 1: Test 6 - Rapid-Fire Brevity (NEW)

**Purpose**: Test brevity mode CDL enhancements

**Questions** (5 total):
1. "Quick question - best budget tripod for backpacking? One sentence only."
2. "10 words or less - secret to sharp handheld shots?"
3. "Yes or no - is Patagonia good for beginners?"
4. "Bullet points only - top 3 wilderness photography safety rules."
5. "Quick check-in - how's your week been? Keep it brief, I'm rushing."

**Scoring**: 60 points total (12 per question)  
**Target**: 48+ points (80%+)  
**Expected**: 80-85% with CDL brevity mode triggers

---

### Task 2: Test 2 Retest - Analytical Mode

**Purpose**: Verify analytical mode CDL tuning fixed 78% issue

**Question** (same as original):
```
Jake, explain the technical camera settings for long-exposure waterfall photography - 
aperture, shutter speed, ISO. Give me the exact numbers and why each matters.
```

**Original Score**: 56/72 (78%) - Poetic metaphors instead of precision  
**Target Score**: 65+ points (90%+)  
**Expected**: 90-95% with CDL analytical mode triggers

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Complete Success
- ‚úÖ Test 6 ‚â• 80% (48+ points)
- ‚úÖ Test 2 Retest ‚â• 90% (65+ points)
- ‚úÖ Final aggregate ‚â• 93%
- ‚úÖ Jake production-ready

### Partial Success
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test 6: 70-79% (needs more brevity tuning)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test 2: 80-89% (needs more analytical tuning)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional CDL refinement recommended

### Needs More Work
- ‚ùå Test 6 < 70% (brevity mode not working)
- ‚ùå Test 2 < 80% (analytical mode insufficient)
- ‚ùå Revisit CDL design

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

### If Tests Pass (Expected)
1. ‚úÖ Commit final validation results
2. ‚úÖ Mark Jake as production-ready (93-95% aggregate)
3. ‚úÖ Create CDL tuning lessons document
4. ‚û°Ô∏è Apply CDL patterns to Ryan migration (821 memories)
5. ‚û°Ô∏è Proceed with Dream (916) / Gabriel (2,897) migrations

### If Additional Tuning Needed
1. Analyze failure patterns in responses
2. Refine CDL triggers (may need more specific keywords)
3. Adjust response style instructions
4. Consider personality vector weight adjustments
5. Retest with enhanced CDL v2

## üí° Key Lessons Learned

### Character-Specific Patterns

**Creative Characters** (Jake):
- Strong artistic expression in personality vector
- Need explicit analytical/brevity mode triggers
- Balance challenge: authenticity vs format compliance

**Educator Characters** (Elena):
- Natural analytical structure in teaching
- Less CDL tuning needed for precision
- Balanced modes from CDL design

### CDL Design Best Practices

**Mode Adaptation**:
- Essential for production readiness
- Character profession influences mode balance
- Explicit triggers prevent personality override
- Maintain character voice across all modes

**Testing Patterns**:
- Test ALL modes (creative, analytical, brevity)
- Character personality may override without triggers
- CDL tuning is character-specific
- Document mode strengths/weaknesses

---

## üìä Jake vs Elena Comparison

### Aggregate Scores (Projected)
- **Jake**: 93-95% (after CDL tuning)
- **Elena**: ~95-96% (baseline)
- Both excellent, different strengths

### Character Patterns
- **Jake**: Stronger creative/emotional, weaker analytical (before CDL)
- **Elena**: Balanced analytical/creative (educator design)

### CDL Tuning Need
- **Jake**: High (photographer personality strong)
- **Elena**: Low (teaching methodology provides structure)

### Production Readiness
- **Both**: Ready after validation complete
- **Jake**: Requires mode adaptation in CDL
- **Elena**: Works well with baseline CDL
