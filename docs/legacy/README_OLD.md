./bot.sh start
```

### 📊 Observability & Metrics

WhisperEngine ships with a lightweight in‑process metrics collector (no external deps) guarded by `ENABLE_METRICS_LOGGING` (default: `true`). It tracks counters & timings for emotional assessment, memory importance, retrieval, pattern learning hooks, and end‑to‑end conversation phases.

Key tooling:

| Purpose | Command (venv active) | Output |
|---------|-----------------------|--------|
| One‑time Sprint 1‑3 feature verification (human readable) | `python verify_sprint_features.py` | Console summary |
| Same verification + machine readable JSON | `python verify_sprint_features.py --json verifications/sprint1_3.json` | JSON file |
| Ad‑hoc metrics snapshot (no workload) | `python scripts/metrics/export_snapshot.py --output metrics_snapshot.json --pretty` | Current counters & timings |
| Reset metrics after snapshot | `python scripts/metrics/export_snapshot.py --reset` | Snapshot + collector cleared |
| Baseline synthetic workload + KPIs | `python scripts/perf/collect_baseline.py --iterations 25 --output baseline_perf.json` | KPIs + raw metrics |

Environment Flag:

```
# .env
ENABLE_METRICS_LOGGING=true   # set false to disable collection
```

Example verification JSON payload structure:

```jsonc
{
    "generated_at": "2025-09-16T12:34:56.123456+00:00",
    "summary": { "total_checks": 7, "passed": 7, "percentage": 100.0 },
    "results": {
        "environment_config": true,
        "database_connectivity": true,
        "sprint1_emotional_intelligence": true,
        "sprint2_memory_importance": true,
        "sprint3_emotional_memory_bridge": true,
        "sprint3_automatic_learning": true,
        "full_integration": true
    },
    "environment": {
        "enable_emotional_intelligence": "true",
        "enable_phase3_memory": "true"
    }
}
```

Metrics snapshot JSON (truncated example):

```jsonc
{
    "generated_at": "2025-09-16T12:35:10.789012+00:00",
    "metrics_enabled": true,
    "snapshot": {
        "counters": [ { "name": "interventions_triggered", "value": 4, "labels": {"type": "support"} } ],
        "timings": [ { "name": "emotional_assessment_seconds", "avg_seconds": 0.034, "count": 10, "min_seconds": 0.028, "max_seconds": 0.042 } ]
    }
}
```

Use cases:
* CI artifact comparison (`git diff` on JSON files) for performance regressions
* Local tuning & before/after measurements when adjusting emotional or memory algorithms
* Historical baselines (store `baseline_perf.json` per release)

> Tip: Pair a metrics snapshot before & after running a workload to measure incremental cost of a new feature.
