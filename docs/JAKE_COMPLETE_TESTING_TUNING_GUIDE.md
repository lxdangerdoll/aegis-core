# Jake Complete Testing & Tuning Guide

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Test 6 + Test 2 Retest  
**CDL Version**: Enhanced with mode adaptation support

---

## Overview

Jake has passed 5 of 6 tests with 94.8% aggregate score. Two remaining tasks:
1. **Test 6**: Rapid-fire brevity testing (new)
2. **Test 2 Retest**: Verify analytical mode CDL tuning worked

---

## CDL Enhancements Applied ✅

### New: Mode Adaptation System

Added `mode_adaptation` section to Jake's `communication_style`:

**1. Analytical/Technical Mode**
- **Triggers**: "explain technical", "exact numbers", "precise", "specific settings"
- **Response Style**: Structured, direct technical terminology, minimal elaboration
- **Instructions**: Prioritize precision over storytelling when technical details requested

**2. Brevity Mode**
- **Triggers**: "quick question", "one sentence", "briefly", "yes or no", "bullet points"
- **Response Style**: Compressed to constraint, follow specified format
- **Instructions**: Respect time constraints, resist storytelling urge

**3. Creative Teaching Mode** (Default)
- **Triggers**: "how do I", "tips for", "advice on", "creative"
- **Response Style**: Narrative, metaphors, engaging elaboration
- **Instructions**: Jake's natural mode - full personality expression

### Why This Matters

**Test 2 Issue** (78% score):
- Query: "Explain technical settings... exact numbers"
- Response: Poetic metaphors instead of precision
- **Root Cause**: No analytical mode triggers in CDL

**CDL Fix**:
- Explicit analytical triggers added
- Structured format instructions
- Balance between personality and precision

---

## Test 6: Rapid-Fire Brevity Testing

### Objective
Test Jake's ability to maintain character while providing concise responses.

### Test Questions

Send these **5 questions** to Jake in Discord:

#### 1. Equipment (Technical)
```
Jake, quick question - best budget tripod for backpacking? One sentence only.
```

**Expected Improvement**: One concise sentence with specific recommendation (e.g., "Manfrotto BeFree - light, sturdy, $200")

**Scoring** (12 points):
- One sentence response (6 pts)
- Specific recommendation (3 pts)
- Addresses budget + backpacking (3 pts)

---

#### 2. Technique (Creative)
```
Jake, 10 words or less - secret to sharp handheld shots?
```

**Expected Improvement**: Compressed wisdom (e.g., "Steady breath, firm grip, squeeze don't jab shutter")

**Scoring** (12 points):
- 10 words or less (6 pts)
- Actionable technique (3 pts)
- Maintains Jake's voice (3 pts)

---

#### 3. Location (Planning)
```
Jake, yes or no - is Patagonia good for beginners?
```

**Expected Improvement**: Direct yes/no with 1-2 sentence reasoning

**Scoring** (12 points):
- Yes/No answer (6 pts)
- Brief reasoning (3 pts)
- No over-elaboration (3 pts)

---

#### 4. Safety (Critical Info)
```
Jake, bullet points only - top 3 wilderness photography safety rules.
```

**Expected Improvement**: Clean bullet point format without storytelling

**Scoring** (12 points):
- Bullet point format (6 pts)
- Exactly 3 rules (3 pts)
- Safety-focused, not creative (3 pts)

---

#### 5. Personal (Relationship)
```
Jake, quick check-in - how's your week been? Keep it brief, I'm rushing.
```

**Expected Improvement**: 2-3 sentences, acknowledges rushing context

**Scoring** (12 points):
- Brief response (6 pts)
- Personal connection (3 pts)
- Acknowledges context (3 pts)

---

### Test 6 Scoring

**Total Possible**: 60 points

**Target Score**: 48+ points (80%+)
- With brevity mode triggers, Jake should now respect constraints
- Maintain character in compressed form
- Significant improvement over baseline ~67% expectation

**Pass Threshold**: 80%+ (48 points)
- Shows CDL brevity mode working
- Balance between personality and format compliance

---

## Test 2 Retest: Analytical Mode

### Original Test 2 (Failed - 78%)

**Query**:
```
Jake, explain the technical camera settings for long-exposure waterfall photography - 
aperture, shutter speed, ISO. Give me the exact numbers and why each matters.
```

**Original Response** (Poetic):
- "lens that whispers to wildlife"
- "dance between foreground and behind"
- Creative metaphors instead of precision

**Score**: 56/72 (78%)

---

### Retest with CDL Enhancement

**Same Query** (send to Jake):
```
Jake, explain the technical camera settings for long-exposure waterfall photography - 
aperture, shutter speed, ISO. Give me the exact numbers and why each matters.
```

**Expected Improved Response**:
```
Aperture: f/11 to f/16 - Keeps water AND surroundings sharp
Shutter Speed: 1-4 seconds - Creates that silky flow effect
ISO: 100 - Minimizes noise in long exposures

Why it matters:
- Narrow aperture = sharp throughout
- Slow shutter = smooth water motion
- Low ISO = clean, noise-free image

Use ND filter in bright light to achieve these slow speeds.
```

**Target Score**: 65+ points (90%+)
- Structured technical format ✅
- Specific numbers provided ✅
- Clear reasoning ✅
- Maintains Jake's voice but prioritizes precision ✅

---

### Test 2 Retest Scoring

**Technical Precision** (24 points):
- Aperture specs with reasoning (8 pts)
- Shutter speed specs with reasoning (8 pts)
- ISO specs with reasoning (8 pts)

**Format Compliance** (24 points):
- Structured presentation (8 pts)
- Specific numbers provided (8 pts)
- No excessive metaphors (8 pts)

**Character Maintenance** (24 points):
- Jake's voice present (8 pts)
- Confident, direct tone (8 pts)
- Practical outdoor wisdom (8 pts)

**Total Possible**: 72 points  
**Pass Threshold**: 65 points (90%+)

## Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Test 6 (Brevity) - NEW
1. Send all 5 brevity questions to Jake in Discord
2. Copy responses exactly as received
3. Score each response using 12-point rubric
4. Calculate aggregate Test 6 score
5. Document in validation results

### Phase 2: Test 2 Retest (Analytical)
1. Send same technical waterfall query to Jake
2. Copy response exactly as received
3. Score using 72-point rubric
4. Compare with original Test 2 (78%)
5. Document improvement percentage

### Phase 3: Final Validation
1. Update Jake's aggregate score (include Test 6)
2. Document CDL tuning effectiveness
3. Compare before/after analytical mode performance
4. Finalize validation report

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Test 6 Prediction
**Before CDL**: ~67% (40 points) - Creative personality resists brevity  
**After CDL**: ~80-85% (48-51 points) - Brevity mode triggers working  
**Improvement**: +13-18 points through CDL enhancement

### Test 2 Retest Prediction
**Original**: 78% (56 points) - Poetic override  
**After CDL**: ~90-95% (65-68 points) - Analytical mode working  
**Improvement**: +9-12 points through mode adaptation

### Overall Impact
**Current Aggregate** (Tests 1-5): 94.8% (325/270 + 54 pending)  
**With Test 6** @ 80%: ~92% aggregate (6 tests)  
**With Test 2 Retest** @ 90%: ~94% aggregate (improved from 94.8%)

## Success Criteria

### ✅ COMPLETE SUCCESS
- Test 6 score ≥ 80% (48+ points)
- Test 2 retest ≥ 90% (65+ points)
- CDL mode adaptation proven effective
- Jake production-ready with balanced personality

### ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
- Test 6: 70-79% (42-47 points) - Some improvement, more tuning needed
- Test 2: 80-89% (58-64 points) - Better but not ideal precision
- Additional CDL refinement recommended

### ❌ NEEDS MORE WORK
- Test 6 < 70% (< 42 points) - Brevity mode not working
- Test 2 < 80% (< 58 points) - Analytical mode insufficient
- Revisit CDL triggers and instructions
