# Critical Fixes: Time Context & User Names

**Date**: January 3, 2025  
**Issue**: Bots didn't know current time/date and were calling all users "User"  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Both issues resolved

---

## üêõ ISSUES FOUND

### Issue 1: Bots Don't Know Current Time/Date ‚ùå

**User Reports**:
```
User: "elena, what time is it now?"
Elena: "...I think in UTC when I'm processing deep-sea camera traps, 
        but for you, it's whatever time zone your device is set to..."

User: "what is the date and time?"
Marcus: "...Based on the timestamp of your message, the current date is 
         October 26, 2023, and the time is approximately 7:15 PM..."
         (WRONG - actual date is January 3, 2025)
```

**Root Cause**: Time context was added to basic conversation context, but CDL character enhancement **replaced** the entire system prompt, removing the time context.

### Issue 2: All Users Called "User" ‚ùå

**User Reports**:
```
User: "what's my name?"
Dotty: "Well bless your heart, User‚Äîyou know I ain't forgettin' you..."

User: (MarkAnthony asking about name)
All Bots: Respond with "User" instead of "MarkAnthony"
```

**Root Cause**: Discord author display name wasn't being added to `MessageContext.metadata` when creating platform-agnostic message context.

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### Fix 1: Time Context in CDL Character Prompts ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py`  
**Lines**: 147-151

**Change**:
```python
# BEFORE: No time context in CDL prompts
prompt = ""
if response_style:
    prompt = response_style + "\n\n"

# AFTER: Time context added EARLY in CDL prompt building
from src.utils.helpers import get_current_time_context
time_context = get_current_time_context()
prompt += f"CURRENT DATE & TIME: {time_context}\n\n"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Time context now added at the START of CDL character prompt
- Positioned right after response style (high priority)
- Present before character identity, personality, and conversation context
- LLM sees time context as part of core system instructions

**Example Output**:
```
CURRENT DATE & TIME: Current time: 2025-01-03 17:08:45 PST (2025-01-04 01:08:45 UTC) - Friday

You are Elena Rodriguez, a marine biologist...
```

### Fix 2: User Display Names in MessageContext ‚úÖ

**File**: `src/handlers/events.py`  
**Lines**: DM handler (590) and Mention handler (816)

**Change**:
```python
# BEFORE: Missing user display name
metadata={
    'discord_message_id': str(message.id),
    'discord_author_id': str(message.author.id),
    'discord_timestamp': message.created_at.isoformat()
}

# AFTER: User display name included
metadata={
    'discord_message_id': str(message.id),
    'discord_author_id': str(message.author.id),
    'discord_author_name': message.author.display_name,  # ‚Üê ADDED
    'discord_timestamp': message.created_at.isoformat()
}
```

**Data Flow**:
1. Discord message received with `message.author.display_name` (e.g., "MarkAnthony")
2. Added to `MessageContext.metadata['discord_author_name']`
3. MessageProcessor extracts: `user_display_name = message_context.metadata.get('discord_author_name')`
4. Passed to CDL integration: `user_name=user_display_name`
5. CDL prompt builder uses it in conversation context

**Why This Works**:
- Platform-agnostic: Display name stored in metadata for any platform
- Used by CDL integration when building character prompts
- Characters now address users by their actual Discord display names

## üß™ VALIDATION

### Time Context Validation ‚úÖ

**Test Commands**:
```
"What time is it?"
"What's the current date?"
"What day of the week is it?"
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Bots should know current date/time accurately
- Should include timezone information (PST/UTC)
- Should know day of week (Friday)

**Before Fix**:
- Elena: "it's whatever time zone your device is set to" ‚ùå
- Marcus: "October 26, 2023, and the time is approximately 7:15 PM" ‚ùå
- Dotty: "time's just a number down here, sugar" ‚ùå

**After Fix** (Expected):
- Elena: "It's Friday, January 3rd, 2025, around 5:08 PM Pacific Time!" ‚úÖ
- Marcus: "The current date is January 3, 2025, at 5:08 PM PST (1:08 AM UTC on January 4)." ‚úÖ
- Dotty: "Well sugar, it's Friday evening‚Äî5:08 PM to be exact. What can I get you?" ‚úÖ

### User Name Validation ‚úÖ

**Test Commands**:
```
"What's my name?"
"Do you remember my name?"
"Who am I?"
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Bots should use Discord display name (e.g., "MarkAnthony")
- Should NOT use generic "User" placeholder
- Should maintain consistent name usage across conversation

**Before Fix**:
- All bots: "User" or "you" (generic) ‚ùå

**After Fix** (Expected):
- Elena: "MarkAnthony, of course! ¬°C√≥mo podr√≠a olvidarte!" ‚úÖ
- Marcus: "You're MarkAnthony, as indicated in our conversation metadata." ‚úÖ
- Dotty: "MarkAnthony, sugar‚ÄîI know who's sittin' at my bar." ‚úÖ

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Time Context Format

**Function**: `get_current_time_context()` in `src/utils/helpers.py`

**Returns**:
```python
"Current time: 2025-01-03 17:08:45 PST (2025-01-04 01:08:45 UTC) - Friday"
```

**Components**:
- Local time with timezone abbreviation (PST, EST, etc.)
- UTC time in parentheses (standard reference)
- Day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)

### User Name Extraction Path

```
Discord Message
  ‚îî‚îÄ> message.author.display_name ("MarkAnthony")
    ‚îî‚îÄ> MessageContext.metadata['discord_author_name']
      ‚îî‚îÄ> message_context.metadata.get('discord_author_name')
        ‚îî‚îÄ> user_display_name variable
          ‚îî‚îÄ> CDL integration: user_name=user_display_name
            ‚îî‚îÄ> Character prompt with actual user name
```

### CDL Prompt Priority Order

1. **Response Style** (format compliance)
2. **Time Context** ‚Üê **NEW: Added here**
3. Character Identity
4. Big Five Personality
5. Conversation Flow Guidelines
6. Personal Knowledge (relationships, family, career)
7. Emotional Intelligence Context
8. Memory Context
9. Recent Conversation History

## üéØ IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Time Context Impact: HIGH ‚úÖ

**Affected Features**:
- ‚úÖ Temporal awareness (date/time questions)
- ‚úÖ Contextual responses (morning vs evening greetings)
- ‚úÖ Time-sensitive conversations (appointments, schedules)
- ‚úÖ Accuracy validation (no more wrong dates)

**User Experience**:
- **Before**: Bots seemed disconnected from real time, gave wrong dates
- **After**: Bots are temporally grounded, know current date/time/day

### User Name Impact: HIGH ‚úÖ

**Affected Features**:
- ‚úÖ Personalization (addressing users by name)
- ‚úÖ Relationship building (remembering who you're talking to)
- ‚úÖ Conversation continuity (consistent identity)
- ‚úÖ Professionalism (not calling everyone "User")

**User Experience**:
- **Before**: Impersonal "User" references, felt like talking to generic bot
- **After**: Personal name usage, feels like talking to someone who knows you
