## 5. Architectural Learnings & Key Takeaways

This testing cycle provided critical insights into creating stable, high-performing AI roleplay characters:

1.  **Conversation History is a Major Risk**: The initial failures (therapeutic behavior) were almost entirely due to conversation history contamination. The **fresh channel testing protocol** is now a mandatory step for validating character consistency.
2.  **Big Five Traits are Foundational**: A single misaligned Big Five personality trait (**Agreeableness** at 50 instead of 35) was a primary driver of undesirable role-play behavior. This validates the importance of fine-tuning these core traits.
3.  **Explicit Anti-Patterns are Effective**: Adding explicit anti-patterns to the CDL (e.g., "Never acts as a therapist") proved highly effective at overriding the LLM's default tendencies and enforcing professional boundaries.
4.  **CDL-Based Styling is Superior**: Moving response style guidance from hardcoded Python prompts into the CDL created a more robust, character-agnostic, and maintainable architecture.
