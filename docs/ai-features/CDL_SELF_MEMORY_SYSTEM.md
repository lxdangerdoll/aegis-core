# CDL Self-Memory & Bot Evolution System with LLM Tool Calling

## 🧠 **Enhanced Vision: AI-Powered Self-Memory**

Transform WhisperEngine bots into **intelligent, self-aware characters** that use LLM Tool Calling to dynamically analyze, extract, and organize personal knowledge, generating authentic self-reflections and evolving naturally through AI-driven insights.

## 🎯 **Core Concept**

### **The Problem**
- Bots currently lack personal memory about themselves
- CDL character data is "prompt-only" - not searchable or dynamic
- No mechanism for bots to learn from their own interactions
- Personal questions like "Do you have a boyfriend?" require manual prompt engineering

### **The Solution: Bot Self-Memory System**
Create a **separate vector memory space** for each bot containing:
1. **Personal Knowledge Base**: CDL background, relationships, goals imported as searchable memories
2. **Self-Reflection Storage**: Bot's evaluations of its own responses and interactions  
3. **Evolution Tracking**: Subtle personality changes based on interaction patterns

## 🛠️ **LLM Tool Calling Integration Architecture**

### **Core Concept: AI-Powered Knowledge Management**
Instead of hardcoded CDL parsing, use **LLM Tool Calling** to:
1. **Intelligently extract** personal knowledge from CDL files
2. **Dynamically categorize** information based on context  
3. **Generate self-reflections** using LLM analysis
4. **Evolve personality insights** through AI-driven evaluation

### **LLM Tools for Bot Self-Memory**

#### **Tool 1: CDL Knowledge Extractor**
```python
@tool("extract_personal_knowledge")
async def extract_personal_knowledge(
    character_file: str,
    knowledge_categories: List[str] = ["relationships", "background", "goals", "habits"],
    extraction_focus: str = "comprehensive"
) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    """
    LLM intelligently extracts and categorizes personal knowledge from CDL character files.
    
    Returns:
        Categorized personal knowledge with search queries and confidence scores
    """
```

#### **Tool 2: Self-Reflection Analyzer**
```python
@tool("analyze_interaction_quality")
async def analyze_interaction_quality(
    user_message: str,
    bot_response: str,
    character_context: str,
    interaction_history: List[Dict] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    LLM analyzes bot's response quality and generates self-reflection insights.
    
    Returns:
        Self-reflection with scores, insights, and improvement suggestions
    """
```

#### **Tool 3: Dynamic Knowledge Query**
```python
@tool("query_personal_knowledge")
async def query_personal_knowledge(
    query: str,
    knowledge_base: List[Dict],
    response_style: str = "authentic"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    LLM intelligently searches and formats personal knowledge for response generation.
    
    Returns:
        Relevant knowledge formatted for natural response integration
    """
```

### **2. Memory Namespace Strategy**
```
User Conversations: "user_{user_id}_{bot_name}"
Bot Self-Memory:   "bot_self_{bot_name}"
```

### **3. Integration Points**
- **CDL Prompt System**: Query self-knowledge for personal questions
- **Response Pipeline**: Store self-reflections after each interaction
- **Character Evolution**: Subtle personality adjustments over time

## 📋 **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: CDL Knowledge Import** 🚀 **[START HERE]**
**Goal**: Enable bots to answer personal questions about themselves

**Features**:
- Import CDL background, relationships, goals into vector memory
- Searchable personal knowledge base
- Integration with existing CDL prompt system

**Use Cases**:
- "Do you have a boyfriend?" → Finds relationship status from CDL
- "Tell me about your childhood" → Retrieves grandmother stories, first snorkeling
- "What are you working on?" → Finds current research projects

**Implementation**:
1. Create `BotSelfMemorySystem` class
2. CDL knowledge import functions
3. Integration with CDL prompt generation
4. Testing with Elena's background data

### **Phase 2: Self-Reflection System** 🔮
**Goal**: Bots evaluate their own responses and learn from interactions

**Features**:
- Post-response LLM analysis of bot's own responses
- Self-evaluation scoring (effectiveness, authenticity, emotional resonance)
- Learning insights storage for future improvement

**Use Cases**:
- Bot notices it's most effective when discussing marine biology
- Self-awareness: "I think that conversation went well because..."
- Response quality improvement over time

**Implementation**:
1. Response quality analysis LLM prompts
2. Self-reflection data models
3. Integration with response pipeline
4. Effectiveness tracking metrics

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Evolution** 🌱
**Goal**: Bots subtly evolve their personalities based on successful interaction patterns

**Features**:
- Conversation success pattern analysis
- Subtle Big Five personality score adjustments
- Long-term memory of effective communication styles
- Personality drift tracking and limits

**Use Cases**:
- Elena becomes slightly more confident after successful science discussions
- Marcus develops stronger empathy based on positive emotional interactions
- Dream maintains mystical core but adapts communication style

**Implementation**:
1. Personality evolution algorithms
2. Success metrics definition
3. Evolution constraints and limits
4. Personality drift monitoring

async def create_character_aware_prompt(self, ...):
    # Existing CDL prompt building...
    
    # NEW: Add bot's self-knowledge for personal questions
    self_knowledge = await self.bot_memory.query_self_knowledge(message_content)
    if self_knowledge:
        prompt += f"\n\nPERSONAL KNOWLEDGE (answer from your own experience):"
        for knowledge in self_knowledge[:3]:  # Top 3 most relevant
            prompt += f"\n- {knowledge['content']}"
    
    # NEW: Include recent self-insights for authenticity
    recent_insights = await self.bot_memory.get_recent_insights(limit=2)
    if recent_insights:
        prompt += f"\n\nRECENT SELF-INSIGHTS:"
        for insight in recent_insights:
            prompt += f"\n- {insight['learning_insight']}"
```

### **Self-Reflection LLM Prompts**
```python
SELF_REFLECTION_PROMPT = """
You are {bot_name}, reflecting on a recent conversation. Analyze your response objectively:

USER MESSAGE: {user_message}
YOUR RESPONSE: {bot_response}
CHARACTER CONTEXT: {character_description}

Rate your response (0.0-1.0) on:
1. Effectiveness: How well did you address the user's needs?
2. Authenticity: How true to your character were you?
3. Emotional Resonance: Did you connect emotionally appropriately?

Provide:
- Brief self-evaluation (2-3 sentences)
- One specific learning insight
- One improvement suggestion for future similar conversations

Be honest and constructive in your self-assessment.
