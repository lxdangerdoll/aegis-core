6. **`create_memory_summary`**
   - Generates intelligent summaries of memory clusters
   - Parameters: memory_group, summary_focus, detail_level
   - Use Case: Creating digestible overviews of complex memory networks

### 3. Intelligent Memory Manager (`src/memory/intelligent_memory_manager.py`)
**Purpose**: AI-driven conversation analysis and coordination
**Key Features**:
- Conversation analysis for memory opportunities
- LLM-powered tool selection and execution
- Action history tracking and learning
- Proactive memory optimization

#### Core Methods:

```python
async def analyze_conversation_for_memory_actions(
    self, 
    user_id: str, 
    conversation_messages: List[Dict[str, str]], 
    context: Dict[str, Any] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

```python
async def analyze_and_optimize_user_memories(
    self, 
    user_id: str, 
    optimization_focus: str = "general"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

## üß† AI Prompt Engineering

### Conversation Analysis Prompt
The system uses sophisticated prompt engineering to analyze conversations:

```
You are an intelligent memory curator for an AI companion system. Your role is to analyze conversations and determine what memories should be stored, updated, or organized to create a meaningful, searchable memory system.

CONTEXT: User conversation with emotional and contextual analysis
GOAL: Recommend specific memory actions using available tools
FOCUS: Semantic meaning, emotional significance, relationship building, future relevance

Available Tools: [6 memory management tools with detailed descriptions]
```

### Memory Optimization Prompt
For proactive memory optimization:

```
You are analyzing a user's existing memory collection to optimize organization, remove outdated information, and enhance retrieval effectiveness.

ANALYSIS FOCUS: Memory relevance, organization efficiency, retrieval patterns
OPTIMIZATION GOALS: Better semantic clustering, outdated content removal, enhanced searchability
```
