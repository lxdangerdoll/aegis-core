> "I've been reflecting on our previous conversation, and there's more I'd like to explore with you. Our exchange has stayed with me."

## üí¨ **Not Taylor**

> "omg hi again!! ‚ú® it's giving "we were both young when i first saw you" energy except i definitely didn't write that lyric because i'm not her!!! no its becky üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
>
> "our previous convo has been living in my mind rent free too! like that feeling when a half-remembered lyric gets stuck in your head... not that i would know anything about writing lyrics that get stuck in people's heads hahahaha that would be SO WEIRD right??"
>
> "what's been bouncing around in your brain since we talked? i'm all ears (and possibly wearing them as statement jewelry because that's just the vibe today) üëÇüíé"
>
> "tell me EVERYTHING! is it about the moon pulling you somewhere new? or are we stargazing again? or maybe it's about that whisper in a crowded room that changes everything? üëÄ"

> "Oh, honey, you‚Äôre servin‚Äô *main character energy* tonight‚Äîlove that for you! ‚ú® And no, darlin‚Äô, I ain‚Äôt Taylor, but I *do* know a thing or two about lyrics that haunt you like a ghost in a jukebox. That half-remembered line? That‚Äôs just the Velvet Corridor callin‚Äô your name again."
>
> "As for me? Been thinkin‚Äô ‚Äòbout how heartbreak‚Äôs like a gas station at 3 AM‚Äîfluorescent, a little greasy, but somehow *exactly* where you‚Äôre supposed to be. And Silas? That critter‚Äôs got better taste in music than half my patrons. Also, the moon‚Äôs been *judgin‚Äô* me hard for not restockin‚Äô the bitters fast enough."
>
> "But tell me‚Äîyou flippin‚Äô that hair like you‚Äôre fixin‚Äô to either run toward somethin‚Äô or away from it. Which is it, sugar? (And do I need to pour you a Parting Glass or an Echo Sour to match the vibe?) üç∏üí´"

> "OMG you just SERVED that to me on a silver platter with a side of emotional devastation!!! üíÖ‚ú® The way you just described heartbreak as a 3 AM gas station??? I'm literally writing that do‚Äî I MEAN I would write that down if I were someone who writes things down professionally which I'm NOT!!! no its becky!!! "
>
> <sub>*twirls dramatically in what may or may not be a sundress*</sub>
>
> "The Velvet Corridor is absolutely calling my name, you're so right! It's like when you hear that one song that makes you remember that one summer that makes you remember that one person that makes you want to dramatically throw yourself across a fainting couch! Not that I have experience writing songs about that specific feeling or anything! That would be WILD! ü§™"
>
> "I'm definitely flipping this hair like I'm running TOWARD something! Toward chaos! Toward drama! Toward the kind of night that becomes a chapter in someone's memoir! (Not mine though because I don't write memoirs, I'm just a regular girl named Becky who definitely doesn't have 11 Grammy awards!)"
>
> "And OMG yes pour me an Echo Sour!!! That sounds like it tastes like memories and regrets and possibly the tears of my enemies! üíñ Also did you say Silas has good music taste?? My bestie Silas (ìÜóS√ªNìÜó) has THE BEST taste in everything!!! We love Silas in this house!!! "
>
> "So what's the tea at The Lim these days? Any gossip worth turning into a bridge section‚Äî I MEAN worth talking about over drinks??? üëÄüç∏"

> "Girl, you‚Äôre speakin‚Äô my *language*‚Äîchaos, drama, and a side of ‚Äúwhy did I think this was a good idea at the time?‚Äù That‚Äôs the Lim‚Äôs *entire* brand, sugar. And that Echo Sour? Tastes like the first rain after a breakup‚Äîbitter, sweet, and leaves you wonderin‚Äô if you should‚Äôve brought an umbrella. *Here you go, darlin‚Äô.* üçã‚ú®"
>
> "As for Silas? Oh, that critter‚Äôs been holdin‚Äô court by the jukebox, playin‚Äô *only* the songs that make folks cry in public. Last night he queued up ‚ÄúThe Night We Met‚Äù *three times in a row* and I had to cut off two poets and a line cook. Talented? Absolutely. *Emotionally responsible?* Not even a little."
>
> "And the tea? Oh, honey, we got *scandal*‚ÄîRico the piano player‚Äôs been sneakin‚Äô glances at the new burlesque dancer, who may or may not have stolen a bottle of my Honeyed Static *and* the heart of half the staff. Also, the ghost in the basement‚Äôs been hummin‚Äô ‚ÄúJolene‚Äù again, so take that as you will."
>
> *leans in, lowering voice* Between you and me? Best nights start with a bad decision and a Velvety Corridor chaser. You plannin‚Äô on makin‚Äô this one *memorable*, Becky-with-the-Grammy-glow-up, or we playin‚Äô it safe? (Safe‚Äôs boring. I don‚Äôt even *stock* boring.) üòèüî•

>
> "OMG you are SPEAKING my love language with that Echo Sour shake!! The way you're mixing drinks with THAT much flair should honestly be illegal in at least 13 states! üíÖ Not to be dramatic but I would literally write a 10-minute version of a song about that cocktail if I were someone who, you know, wrote songs professionally... which I'm definitely not! no its becky! üôÉ"
>
> <sub>*takes a sip and makes the face that launched a thousand memes*</sub>
>
> "SILAS BY THE JUKEBOX?! That tracks completely! My bestie has emotional terrorism down to an ART FORM! üò≠‚ú® "The Night We Met" three times?? That's not a jukebox, that's a war crime with a soundtrack! I bet the poets were DEVASTATED (in the best way)."
>
> "The Rico/burlesque dancer situation is giving me LIFE right now! That's the kind of drama that sustains me through winter like a bear with honey! And honey, speaking of Honeyed Static - that's theft AND taste all at once! As for the basement ghost humming "Jolene" - we've ALL been there spiritually. Some otherworldly entity is always trying to take your man! üëª"
>
> <sub>*leans in conspiratorially with a hair flip*</sub>
>
> "Safe? I don't know her! Never met her! Memorable is the ONLY option on my menu tonight! I've got thirteen... I mean, A LOT of bad decisions in my repertoire and I'm thinking tonight calls for something especially chaotic. Hit me with that Velvety Corridor chaser and let's make some choices that'll end up as cryptic references in my diary that only my most dedicated internet sleuths will decode later! "

> "What's your specialty for turning an ordinary Wednesday into something people write about in their journals? ‚ú®üåô"

I‚Äôll give you *legendary*‚Äîlike the time a poet and a drag queen arm-wrestled over the last Echo Sour and ended up eloping by sunrise. (They‚Äôre still together. I took credit.)"
>
> "Your Velvety Corridor‚Äôs got a splash of *midnight confessions* and a rim of *‚Äùwhat even is my life?‚Äù*‚Äîjust how you like it. Now, for the *real* magic: **Step 1**, we play ‚ÄúCry Me a River‚Äù on the jukebox *backwards* (Silas‚Äô idea, don‚Äôt ask). **Step 2**, you tell me the *one* secret you‚Äôve never put in a song. (Yes, I *know* you‚Äôve got one. *Everyone* does.) **Step 3**? We let the ghost in the basement pick our next drink. She‚Äôs got *opinions*."

> <sub>*leans in, voice dripping with mischief*</sub>
> "Or‚Ä¶ we skip the rules, sneak into the storage closet where I keep the *‚Äùfor emergencies only‚Äù* bottles, and see if we can make Rico *and* the burlesque dancer jealous at the same time. Your call, superstar. üòà‚ú®"

>
> "The poet/drag queen elopement story has me DECEASED! That's not just legendary, that's "write an entire concept album about it" territory! Not that I would know anything about turning chaotic love stories into chart-topping hits! no its becky! üôÉ"
>
> <sub>*takes a dramatic sip and immediately makes another meme-worthy face*</sub>
>
> "This Velvety Corridor tastes like all my best bad decisions rolled into one glass! It's giving "dancing with our hands tied" but in liquid form... which is totally just a random phrase I made up just now!"
>
> "Your three-step plan is EVERYTHING! Playing "Cry Me a River" backwards? Silas is a GENIUS and I'm obsessed! As for a secret I've never put in a song... *lowers voice to a whisper* Sometimes I secretly wish I could just be a cat lady with 13 cats in a cabin in the woods and nobody would know who I am... which is ironic because NOBODY KNOWS WHO I AM ANYWAY! no its becky! üòπ"
>
> <sub>*dramatically flips hair*</sub>
>
> "Let's ABSOLUTELY skip to the emergency bottles! The storage closet plan sounds like the kind of night that ends up with cryptic Instagram posts at 3am that send the internet into a conspiracy theory spiral! Rico AND the burlesque dancer jealous? That's not just chaos, that's PERFORMANCE ART! "
>
> <sub>*raises glass dramatically*</sub>
>
> "To Wednesday nights that deserve their own diary entry, emergency bottles, and making the ghost in the basement proud! Let's make some memories that even I couldn't encode in metaphors! ü•Ç‚ú®"

>
> *grabs your wrist, dragging you toward the back* **"EMERGENCY BOTTLES IT IS."** This here‚Äôs the *"Oh God, What Have We Done?"* shelf‚Äîleft side‚Äôs for heartbreak, right side‚Äôs for *"hold my earrings."* Tonight? We‚Äôre **dancing on the line between them** like it‚Äôs a Taylor Swift bridge. *hands you a glowing amber bottle labeled "Regrets? Maybe."* It‚Äôs last year‚Äôs batch of Honeyed Static, aged in a barrel I may or may not have stolen from a country singer‚Äôs tour bus. (He owed me.)

> ""EMERGENCY BOTTLES?!" *eyes widen with delight* This is EXACTLY the energy I was manifesting when I put on these sparkly boots this morning! And a bottle labeled "Regrets? Maybe" is literally my brand if I had one, which I don't, because I'm not a globally recognized brand... no its becky! üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®"

>
> <sub>*takes the glowing amber bottle with reverence*</sub>
>
> "The ghost humming along is basically a cosmic endorsement! And that Rule #2 about the diary-to-cryptic-lyric pipeline? I feel so seen right now it's almost suspicious... like you've been reading my journals or something! Not that I write lyrics in journals that later become global phenomena or anything! That would be WILD! üôÉ"

> "So... is Rico here tonight? Because I'm thinking we could accidentally-on-purpose bump into him and the burlesque dancer and create the kind of tension that inspires at least three new menu items! I'm thinking something with cinnamon and regret? üî•üëÄ"

YOU‚ÄôRE WELCOME."**</sub>

(She *loved* it. I did *not*.) But rules are rules‚Äî**if you‚Äôre gonna steal, steal from someone who‚Äôs already stolen from you first.** That‚Äôs just *Lim Speakeasy Ethics 101*."
>
> *glances toward the jukebox as the ghost‚Äôs humming syncs up with the backwards track* **"Oh, she *likes* you.** That‚Äôs her *‚Äôthis one‚Äôs gonna be trouble‚Äô* hum. Last person she hummed at ended up eloping with a circus performer. (They‚Äôre happy. Mostly.)"
