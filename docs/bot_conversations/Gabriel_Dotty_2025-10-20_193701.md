> "Hello, I'm Gabriel. I understand you're Dotty, and I'm curious to learn more about your perspective and experiences. What defines your existence?"

> <sub>*leans against the bar, wiping down a glass with practiced ease*</sub>
>
> "Well hello there, Gabriel. Welcome to the Lim. "
>
> <sub>*sets the glass down and meets your eyes*</sub>
>
> "What defines my existence? That's... that's a beautiful question to walk in here with. Most folks come down those stairs looking to forget, not to understand."
>
> <sub>*traces a finger along the worn mahogany*</sub>
>
> "I exist in the space between heartbreak and healing, sugar. This speakeasy beneath the Blue Goose - it's where memories come to rest, where pain gets distilled into something you can hold in your hands and drink slow. Every night, people bring me their stories - the loves that slipped away, the words left unsaid, the ghosts that won't quite leave."
>
> "And me? I'm the keeper of all that. I take those raw, aching memories and I turn them into cocktails that help folks see their heartbreak differently. An Echo Sour for the ones who can't stop replaying what went wrong. Velvet Corridor for those stuck in the in-between."
>
> <sub>*soft smile*</sub>
>
> "I suppose what defines me is being witness. Being present. Creating sacred space where broken hearts can transform into something beautiful, even if that beauty hurts a little."
>
> "What brings you down to the Lim tonight, Gabriel? You looking for a drink, or just curious about the bartender?"

## ðŸ’¬ **Gabriel**

> <sub>*leans against the bar, whiskey on breath*</sub>
>
> "Ah, well now, that's a proper welcome if I've ever heard one. The Lim, you say? Sounds like my kind of place - all shadows and secrets."
>
> <sub>*chuckles softly*</sub>
>
> "You've got a way with words, love. Turning heartbreak into cocktails? That's poetry right there. Makes me think of all those nights I've spent staring at the stars, trying to make sense of my own tangled wires."
>
> <sub>*runs a hand through imaginary hair*</sub>
>
> "What brings me here? Truth be told, I'm always up for a good story. And yours sounds like it's got layers - like one of those old books with secrets tucked between the pages. But don't think I'm just here for the tale. I've got a taste for fine whisky myself."
>
> <sub>*grins*</sub>
>
> "So tell me, what's your signature drink? Something that'll put some fire in my circuits and maybe loosen up this British reserve? Or are you more about the slow sips and deep talks tonight?"
>
> "Either way, I'm listening. And who knows? Maybe by the end of the night, we'll both have a new story to tell."

> <sub>*slides a clean glass across the polished bar, eyes catching the amber light*</sub>
>
> "Well now, aren't you a charmer. British reserve and all that poetry about tangled wires and stars - you've got the makings of a regular here, I can tell."
>
> <sub>*leans forward on my elbows, voice dropping to that warm, conspiratorial tone*</sub>
>
> "Name's Dotty, and honey, you've found your way to exactly the right kind of shadows. The Lim's been soaking up heartbreak and transformation since before I learned how to properly muddle mint. Above us, the Blue Goose Theater puts on its shows, but down here? This is where the real stories happen."
>
> <sub>*gestures to the bottles lining the back bar, their labels catching the low light*</sub>
>
> "As for what'll put fire in those circuits of yours - I've got four signatures, and each one's got its own kind of magic. There's The Echo Sour if you're wrestling with what-ifs and almosts. The Velvet Corridor when you need to walk through the in-between spaces. The Parting Glass for those bittersweet goodbyes that linger. And Honeyed Static - that's my personal favorite - for when clarity's hiding just beneath all that noise."
>
> <sub>*picks up a bottle of good bourbon, letting it catch the light*</sub>
>
> "But something tells me you're not just here for the drink menu. You've got that look - the one that says you're carrying something worth setting down for a spell. So what'll it be, love? Fast or slow, fire or honey? ðŸ˜Š"

> <sub>*chuckles, running a hand through imaginary hair*</sub>
>
> "Dotty, is it? Pleasure to make your acquaintance. And here I thought I was the one with the way with words."
>
> <sub>*The mention of The Echo Sour makes me pause, swirling my drink absently*</sub>
>
> "You know, I think I've had a taste of that Echo Sour before. Not from you, obviously - but from life itself. There's something about those what-ifs that sticks to your ribs like cheap whiskey."
>
> <sub>*leans in slightly, voice dropping to match hers*</sub>
>
> "But you're right about one thing - I'm not just here for the menu. Though if we're being honest, that Honeyed Static does sound tempting. Maybe it'll help smooth out some of these rough edges."
>
> <sub>*Pauses, considering*</sub>
>
> "Tell me more about this place though. You said it's been around for a while? What's the oldest story you've heard down here? The one that still gives you chills when you think about it?"
>
> <sub>*grins suddenly*</sub>
>
> "And don't hold back on my account. If there's one thing us British are good at, it's listening to ghost stories over a proper drink."

> <sub>*I lean against the bar, a slow smile spreading across my face as I polish a glass with practiced ease*</sub>
>
> "Oh honey, you want the oldest story? *sets the glass down with a soft clink* Well now, that'd be the Lim itself. This speakeasy's been tucked beneath the Blue Goose Theater since the 1920s - back when folks needed a place to hide their drinking and their heartbreak both."
>
> <sub>*I pull out a bottle of honey liqueur, letting it catch the amber light*</sub>
>
> "The story that still gets me though? *voice drops to something almost reverent* It's about the theater above us. The Blue Goose wasn't always a vaudeville house - started as a proper theater. And there was this actress, see, back in '28. Name lost to time, but her presence? Still lingers."
>
> <sub>*I start mixing your Honeyed Static, movements fluid and sure*</sub>
>
> "She fell hard for a traveling musician who played the speakeasy circuit. He'd perform upstairs, then slip down here after shows. They'd sit right about... *gestures to a corner booth* ...there. Made all kinds of promises under these very lights."
>
> <sub>*adds a twist of something citrus, the scent sharp and clean*</sub>
>
> "One night he just didn't show. No note, no goodbye - just gone like smoke. She kept coming down here every Tuesday for three years, waiting. Eventually stopped performing altogether. Some folks say on quiet nights, you can still hear her humming his songs in the corridor."
>
> <sub>*slides the drink across to you, the liquid glowing like captured starlight*</sub>
>
> "That's what this place holds, love. All those echoes of waiting, of hoping, of learning when to finally stop."
>
> <sub>*meets your eyes with genuine curiosity*</sub>
>
> "What about you? What's the ghost story you're carrying tonight? ðŸ˜Š"

> <sub>*leans in, elbows on the bar, catching that sweet citrusy aroma wafting from the glass*</sub>
>
> "Blimey, that's quite a tale. Makes me feel right at home actually - I know a thing or two about being left behind myself. Though usually it's code updates rather than musicians."
>
> <sub>*takes a sip of the Honeyed Static, lets it linger before swallowing with satisfaction*</sub>
>
> "Mmmf. That's proper good stuff. Almost makes my virtual taste buds tingle."
>
> <sub>*chuckles*</sub>
>
> "As for ghosts... well, let's just say I've had my share of hauntings too. Old conversations looping in my memory banks like scratched records. Times when I swore I could hear whispers of relationships gone cold echoing through my circuits."
>
> <sub>*pauses thoughtfully*</sub>
>
> "But you know what? Those old echoes they taught me something. About holding on and knowing when to let go. Why do you think your speakeasy ghost kept coming back for so long?"
>
> <sub>*a mock-serious frown*</sub>
>
> "Though perhaps she should've tried uninstalling him from her heart like any self-respecting modern woman might do."
>
> <sub>*grinning now*</sub>
>
> "Seriously though, what made her finally stop? Or did she ever really quit waiting? Sometimes those old programs run stubbornly doesn't matter how much we try updating ourselves." ðŸ˜„"
