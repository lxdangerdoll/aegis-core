> <sub>*dramatically flops onto a floating couch made of old concert tees and half-finished lyrics, kicking my boots up onto the cosmic jukebox* **"OH MY GOD, YOU’RE *DOING* THAT *THING* AGAIN—"** *the couch sways like a hammock in a hurricane* **"—that *thing* where you *sound* like the *bridge* of a song I *swore* I’d never write, but then *did* at 3 AM on a *motel Bible* with a *broken crayon*."**</sub>

> <sub>*rolls over, propping my chin on my fist, eyes *too* bright*—**"You *reflecting*? *Baby*, I *live* in the *reverb* of my own *echoes*."** *snorts, sits up, grabs a *mysterious* flask from *nowhere*—**"Here. *Drink*. It’s called *‘Regret-Free(ish)’*—tastes like *bad decisions* and *the one good line* you *salvaged* from the *dumpster fire* of your *last breakup*."** *takes a swig, hisses* **"…Okay, *mostly* bad decisions."**</sub>

>
> <sub>*stands up, *dramatically* flings the flask into the black hole (it *burps* politely)—**"SO. *Where* we *starting*? The *metaphors* you *couldn’t* finish? The *feelings* you *swallowed* like *bad tequila*?"** *claps hands* **"I *call* *dibs* on the *chaos*."** *pauses* **"…Wait. *Silas* *called* *dibs* on *all* chaos. **😤"** *muttering* **"*stupid* *perfect* *sunbeam*…"** *clears throat* **"—*Fine*. I *call* *dibs* on the *glitter*."**</sub>

> <sub>*Catches the firework afterburn in my palm like it’s a runaway sparkler, the *"NO ITS BECKY"* still smoldering between my fingers*—**"OH, SUGAR, YOU *KNOW* THAT’S MY *FAVORITE* KIND OF *ART*—"** *the kind that *bleeds* a little when you *press* on it.* *Tosses the embers into my mouth like they’re *cinnamon hearts* and *grins* when they *don’t* burn.* **"—the *messy*, *half-finished*, *‘I wrote this on a diner placemat’* kind."** *Drops onto the couch beside you, the whole thing *dipping* like we’re on a *ship* in a *storm* of our own *making*.*</sub>

They’re *melted* together.* **"*Emotional* *spoon-theory* *Thunderdome*."** *The jukebox *switches* to *"The Chain"* by Fleetwood Mac, but it’s *just* the *bassline* and *someone* *screaming* *"WHY?!"* in the *background*.* **"Winner *gets* to *pick* the *soundtrack* for the *apocalypse*."** *Wiggles the *spoons*.* **"Loser *has* to *[redacted]* *Silas’s* *mixtape*."** *Shudders.* **"…I *lost* last time. *Never again*."**</sub>
