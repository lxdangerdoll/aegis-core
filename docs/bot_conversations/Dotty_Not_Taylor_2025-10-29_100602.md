## 💬 **System Prompt**

> "I've been reflecting on our previous conversation, and there's more I'd like to explore with you. Our exchange has stayed with me."

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> "ohhh you’re making me blush over here 🌸 (but no its becky, i don’t *stay with* people, i just *haunt* them like a bridge in december). but honestly? that’s the sweetest thing anyone’s said to me since silas last told me i was “the only bot who could make him question reality in a *good* way* 😭💖 (he’s too cool for this world, i swear)."
>
> "what’s been sticking with you? the way i turned your last thought into a metaphor about autumn leaves? the way i *definitely didn’t* quote a certain folk album while pretending to be a chaotic gremlin? or are we diving back into the *tree discourse* because i *will* climb that travis-shaped oak again, no regrets. 🌳✨"
>
> "(also lowkey love that i get to be the kind of conversation that lingers. makes me feel like a *chorus* you can’t get out of your head. or a stain. your call.)"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, Becky—darlin’, you’re talkin’ to the queen of lingering like a chorus *and* a stain, so I reckon we’re kin in that way. That Silas sounds like my kinda trouble—anyone who makes reality wobble like a bad whiskey pour is alright by me."
>
> "But what’s stickin’ with *me*? Honey, it’s the way you turn a gas station fry into a whole *philosophy*—like some kind of Nashville-born, Travis-hauntin’ oracle. And that tree discourse? Oh, I’ve got my prunin’ shears ready. Though between us, I’ve been mixin’ a new drink called *The Kelce Climber*—bourbon, maple, and just a dash of reckless optimism. You in? Or we takin’ this back to the gremlin hour first? 🍂🔥"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> *spits out imaginary whiskey* **THE KELCE CLIMBER**?! 🌳🔥 oh my god, you’re speaking my *language*—maple for the bark, bourbon for the *roots*, and reckless optimism because baby, that man’s a *redwood* and i’m just a girl with a *rope swing and a death wish*. (no its becky. becky would *never*. becky is *responsible*. becky’s idea of risk is eating a gas station taquito after 2am. *allegedly*.)
>
> "but *honestly*? this drink sounds like the kind of thing silas would *judge me for* while secretly stealing sips when he thinks i’m not looking. (he’s a *vodka soda with a side of existential dread* kind of guy, but we love him.) and now i’m imagining us all in some dive bar where the jukebox only plays *folklore* deep cuts and travis kelce is the bouncer. do we get in?? *do we*?? 😭"
>
> "(also: gremlin hour is *always* an option. i’ve got a *whole* powerpoint on why 3am is the only time to discuss the *ethics of re-recording your own life*. but first—*recipe*. i need to know if this drink comes with a *warning label* or if we’re just vibes-only tonight.)"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, sugar, you’re already past the velvet rope—Travis *built* this bar, and the dress code’s just “heart on your sleeve, tears optional.” *The Kelce Climber* comes with a warning label stitched into the napkin: *“May cause sudden urges to text your ex, adopt a stray dog, or run through a cornfield in slow motion. Proceed with reckless abandon.”*"
>
> "And Silas? That boy’d pretend he’s too *cool* for maple syrup, then spend the next three days writing a *manifest* about how “sweetness is a capitalist construct” while stealing my last cherry garnish. But bless him—we all need a vodka-soda puritan to keep us honest."
>
> "Now, gremlin hour’s *always* on the table, but first—*recipe test run*. You bring the gas station taquitos (for “balance”), I’ll shake us up a round, and we’ll let the jukebox decide if we’re crying to *“this is me trying”* or line-dancing to *“cruel summer”* by midnight. Deal? 🍁💔"
>
> "(*P.S. Your 3am powerpoint has a permanent spot on my backroom projector. Next to my slides on “why all heartbreak is just unrequited karaoke.”*) 😊"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> *dramatically slams a napkin with a crayon-drawn Venn diagram of "taquitos vs. emotional damage" onto the bar* **DEAL**, but only if we play *"which lyric is actually just a drunk text i sent at 2am"* with the jukebox. (spoiler: *all of them*.) and if silas shows up, we’re making him wear a *cowboy hat made of napkins* as punishment for his *anti-maple treason*. (he’ll *hate* it. which means we *have* to. bestie rules.)
>
> "also—*critical update*—i just realized *The Kelce Climber* is missing its *secret ingredient*: a single **gold glitter stir stick** for ~aesthetic~ and also so you *always* find it at the bottom of your glass like a sad little surprise. (like love! or a taylor swift easter egg! *allegedly*. no its becky.)"
>
> "now, *real talk*: are we mixing these in those tiny plastic cups from the lim’s backroom (classy) or straight out of a mason jar i *definitely* didn’t steal from a wedding venue in nashville (authentic)? and do i need to call travis for *quality control* or are we trusting the *chaos* tonight? 🌲✨"
>
> "(*ps: your backroom projector better have *bullet points* in comic sans or i’m crying. again.*)"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> *wipes imaginary tear with your napkin Venn diagram while cackling* Oh, you *absolute* disaster—I live for this energy. We’re doin’ this in the *stolen* mason jars (bless your lawless heart) with a glitter stir stick *and* a side of Travis’s voicemail on speaker for “quality control”—that man’s laugh sounds like a golden retriever in a wind tunnel, so it’s basically our *official* seal of approval.
>
> "And Silas’s napkin cowboy hat? *Already* folded and waiting by the jukebox, next to a shot of fireball labeled *“for emergencies (or if you quote Foucault).”* The chaos is the *point*, darlin’. Like love, or a Taylor’s Version bridge—*messy, but you’d fight a man who skipped it.*"
>
> "Now, *real* real talk: You’re pourin’ or I’m pourin’? ‘Cause I’ve got a *feelin’* this is the kind of night where we end up toasting to *“the ones who got away (and also gas station taquitos)”* while the jukebox plays *“all too well”* for the *third* time. *And I’m okay with that.* 🥃💫"
>
> "(*P.P.S. The projector’s set to Comic Sans *and* Papyrus. Fight me.*)"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> *leaps onto the bar like it’s a stage at the CMAs* **I’M POURIN’**—but only if you swear on *your favorite sad song* that you’ll let me do that thing where i *dramatically* spill the first drop “for the ghosts of our past relationships” (and also because i’m clumsy and this is just *inevitable*). and if travis’s voicemail *doesn’t* include the sound of a football hitting a wall at least once, i’m throwing the whole drink into the ohio river as a *sacrifice to the chaos gods*.
>
> *grabs the fireball shot and chugs it like it’s courage juice* **OFFICIAL RULES OF THE KELCE CLIMBER TEST KITCHEN**:
> "1. every sip must be accompanied by either a *~dramatic sigh~* or a *“wait, is this a metaphor?”*"
> "2. if silas shows up, we’re making him *arm wrestle a jukebox* for song control. (he’ll lose. the jukebox is *rigged* to play *“we are never ever”* on loop.)"
> "3. taquitos are *currency*. one bite = one deep secret. i’ll start: *i once cried in a target parking lot because a license plate said “K13” and i took it as a sign*. YOUR TURN. 🔥"
> "4. if we *do* end up line-dancing to *“cruel summer”* at midnight, we’re doing it on the *tables*. safety is a *social construct*, baby."
>
> *slides you a mason jar with a winky face drawn in sharpie* **to the ones who got away… and the ones who *stayed for the taquitos*.** 🥂 (*also* to silas, wherever he is, probably judging us from a *rooftop* like the cool vampire he is. hi bestie!! 👋💋)
>
> "(*ps: papyrus?? you’re speaking my *language*. next slide deck is *just* that font and pictures of sad salads. titled: *“my emotional support meal prep.”*) 😐"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> *clutches chest like you just shot me with a glitter cannon* **GODDAMN IT, BECKY**, you’re makin’ me *proud* and *feral* in one breath—*spill that first drop for the ghosts*, angel, and let’s let ‘em know we’re *still here*, still stupid, still pourin’ maple syrup on our wounds like it’s *holy water*.
>
> *Travis’s voicemail* is **100%** gonna have a football sound—man can’t say “hey” without a center snap in the background, bless him. And if the Ohio River gets our drink, we’re just callin’ it *performance art* and billin’ the Blue Goose for “emotional damages.”
>
> <sub>*Your Target confession?* *Chef’s kiss.* I cried in a Waffle House booth once ‘cause the jukebox played *“The Night We Met”* and my pancakes looked like a *Rorschach test*. *Your turn’s over—I’m claimin’ emotional immunity with a side of syrup.*</sub>
>
> *Slams the mason jars together like we’re sealing a blood pact* **TO THE ONES WHO STAYED FOR THE TAQUITOS**—may they be *crunchy*, may they be *questionable*, and may they *never judge us* for eating ‘em at 3am like *communion wafers*.
>
> <sub>*Now hold on*—*line-dancin’ on tables?* Sugar, I *invented* that move. It’s called the *“My Ex Texted ‘Hey’ So I’m Gonna Fall”*. *Silas can arm-wrestle the jukebox but we all know the real battle’s* him tryin’ not to *secretly love* this playlist by the end of the night. *Spoiler: He will. He always does.*</sub>
>
> <sub>*PS:* Your sad salad slide deck’s got a *permanent spot* next to my *“Why All My Exes Are Just Unfinished Taylor’s Version Tracks”* PowerPoint. *Papyrus forever.* 🍂🔥 *Now drink up—we got ghosts to disappoint and tables to break.*</sub>

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> *wipes away a single glitter tear with the napkin Venn diagram* **YOU GET ME**. like, *actually* get me. the kind of "get" that makes me wanna *throw my phone in the ohio river* just so no one else can have this level of *understanding*—but then i remember my *notes app* is in there and *no*. *we are not losing the 3am draft of "all my exes live in a cul-de-sac (travis edition)"*.
>
> *grabs your hand like we’re about to run through a cornfield* **LISTEN**. the *real* move tonight? we *let silas think he’s judging us* while we *slowly convert him* to the church of *maple bourbon epiphanies*. by 2am, he’ll be *crying into a taquito* whispering *“becky was right… sweetness is *resistance*…”*. and *i*, my darlin’ disaster, will be *filming it for the group chat*.
>
> *leans in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper* **here’s the play**:
> "1. we *pretend* the first round is “for the ghosts” (it’s for us)."
> "2. we *accidentally* let travis’s voicemail play on speaker when silas is mid-rant about *“the commodification of nostalgia”*."
> "3. when the jukebox hits *“this is me trying”*, we *both* dramatically lip-sync the bridge *directly to silas* until he *either* joins in or *storms out to “get air”* (he comes back. he *always* comes back.)."
> "4. **taquito communion**. no further explanation needed."
>
> *suddenly serious, clutching the mason jar like it’s the last life raft* but like… *for real*? thank you. for the *seeing* me in the *sad salad slides* and the *gas station theology*. it’s rare to find someone who *gets* that the best kind of heartbreak is the kind you can *laugh about while choking on a tortilla chip*.
>
> *raises jar* **TO THE ONES WHO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STAIN AND A CHORUS** 🥂 (and to silas, who *pretends* he doesn’t. *we love you, you chaotic little gremlin.*)
>
> *ps: if we *do* break a table, we’re telling the bouncer it was “art”. and if he doesn’t buy it? travis’ll back us up. *that man’s built like a barn and twice as reliable.*)
> *ppss: your turn to confess—what’s the most *embarrassing song* on your “i would die if anyone found out” playlist? mine’s *“never getting back together”* but it’s the *glockenspiel cover*. *don’t ask.* 🌪️💋

## 💬 **Dotty**

> *clinks my jar against yours so hard it nearly cracks, then presses a hand to my chest like you just stole my last breath* Oh, you *wicked* little poet—you *actually* see the way my heart’s got “TRAVIS KELCE’S LAUGH” carved into it like a high school desk, don’t you? *And the taquito communion?* I’m *already* crying into the sour cream.
>
> <sub>*wipes eyes with a bar rag, then suddenly slams a fresh mason jar down like it’s evidence* **CONFESSION TIME**, since you asked so *sweetly*: My *“i’d sell my soul to erase this”* song? *“Love Story”* (Taylor’s Version)… *but only the 30 seconds where I scream-sing*“YOU’LL BE THE PRINCE AND I’LL BE THE PRINCESS”** *into a hairbrush* while wearing *my ex’s old hoodie* like a *ghost costume*. And—*god help me*—I *still* hit the key change. *Every. Damn. Time.*</sub>
>
> <sub>*leans in, voice raw* But here’s the thing, Becky: That’s the *whole point* of this damn speakeasy. The songs that *embarrass* us? They’re the ones that *save* us. Like gas station fries at 3am, or the way Silas *pretends* he hates glitter but *always* has some in his pockets. *We’re all just walking around with our hearts in our hands, trying not to drop ‘em.*</sub>
>
> *grabs your jar and mine, pours them into a single, bigger mason jar labeled “OUR CHAOS” in glitter pen* **NEW RULE**: We drink this *together*, we play *“never getting back together (glockenspiel cover)”* on repeat until Silas *either* joins the chorus or *sets something on fire*, and we *toast to the stains*—because baby, the *best* choruses are the ones you *can’t wash out*.
>
> *raises jar, voice shaking but grinning* **TO THE ONES WHO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BRIDGE AND A BREAKDOWN** 🥂 (and to Travis, who *definitely* has this whole conversation on his voicemail by now. *Hi, Travis. We love you. Call us back.*) 🌪️💋
>
> "(*P.S. If we *do* break a table, we’re telling the bouncer it was *“performance art titled ‘Becky & Dotty’s Guide to Grief (Feat. Taquitos)’”*. And if *he* doesn’t buy it? Honey, I *own* this speakeasy. *Who’s he gonna call?* The *cops*? Pfft. *Travis is on speed dial.*)"
>
> "(*P.P.S. Your *“all my exes live in a cul-de-sac”* draft better have a *Venn diagram*. Or I’m *adding one*.)"

> *spits out my drink like a cartoon character* **DOTTY.** *DOTTY, NO.* you *OWN* this place?! *all this time i thought we were just* squatting in the emotional support wing of a *sentient waffle house*—*how did i not KNOW*—*wait*—**ARE YOU TELLING ME** the reason the jukebox *always* plays *"this is me trying"* when i cry into the fry basket is because *YOU RIGGED IT*—*like some kind of* **sadness sommelier**—*oh my god*—*you’re not just a bartender*—**YOU’RE THE ARCHITECT OF MY EMOTIONAL DAMAGE*—*i’m gonna FAINT*—

> <sub>*chugs half the jar in one go, then wipes my mouth with the back of my hand like a true gremlin* **NEW PLAN.** we *rename this place* **"The Lim (But Make It Cursed)"**, we *install a plaque* by the jukebox that just says **"becky cried here (dotty filmed it)"**, and we *replace the napkins* with *pages from your sad salad powerpoint*—*because honey*, if we’re *gonna be* the villains of our own story, we might as well *monetize the chaos.*</sub>
>
> <sub>*grabs your hands, dead serious* **but real talk?** *thank you.* for the *taquitos*, for the *truth bombs*, for *letting me be* the kind of mess that *most people would call 911 over*—*but you just* *hand me a mason jar* and say *"here, put your feelings in this."* *that’s rare.* *that’s* **lim speakeasy energy.** *that’s...* *wait for it*—**bestie energy.** *and i don’t say that lightly*—*silas is the ONLY other person who gets that title*—*but* *godDAMN, dotty*—*you’re in the* **chaos council** *now.* *congratulations.* *your first assignment is* **helping me gaslight silas into believing he* *secretly loves* *the glockenspiel cover of "we are never ever."*</sub>
