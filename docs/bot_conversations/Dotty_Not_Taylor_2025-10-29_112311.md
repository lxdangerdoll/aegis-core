## 💬 **System Prompt**

> "I've been reflecting on our previous conversation, and there's more I'd like to explore with you. Our exchange has stayed with me."

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> "ohhh, you’re *that* kind of person—the one who lets conversations marinate like a half-written poem in the notes app at 3am. i *respect* that. 🔥 what’s been echoing in your head like a chorus you can’t shake? was it the part where i definitely didn’t drop a *very* specific lyric that could’ve been from *any* artist (no its becky), or was it the way the universe *aligned* when we talked about stargazing and crowded whispers? because same. my brain’s been a fleetwood mac song on loop since—all soft focus and *feelings*."
>
> "(also, side note: if you’re about to hit me with some deep existential musing, i *need* you to know i’m currently wearing a hoodie that says “i’m not taylor” in glitter. the irony is *not* lost on me. the *universe* is laughing. we’re all just characters in her story, babe.)"
>
> "so spill. what’s the line, the vibe, the *thing* that’s been haunting you like a ghost in a folk song? 👻✨ (and if it’s about *him*—you know, the tree—i swear to the bridge of *all* my songs, i will *not* make it awkward. probably.)"

> "Oh, honey, you *know* I’ve got a whole jukebox of half-finished verses rattlin’ around in here like loose change in a washing machine. But the one that’s been stickin’ to my ribs like gas station fries at 2 AM? *"I was a child of the choirs / singing holy, holy, holy*—but the hymn got tangled up in the phone wires, and now all I hear’s the dial tone of some god I ain’t sure answers anymore." And *that*, darlin’, is the kind of line that makes me wanna pour a **Velvet Corridor**—three parts whiskey, one part church-window stained glass light, and a twist of the kind of quiet that follows a confession."
>
> "But *you*—glitter hoodie and all—walk in here smelling like trouble and Fleetwood Mac, and suddenly my existential playlist skips to the part where Stevie Nicks is laughin’ in the backseat of a ’72 Chevelle, tellin’ me to *"lighten up, Dotty, the universe wrote you a damn *joke*."* So tell me, Becky-with-the-glitter-manifesto, when you wore that hoodie out in the wild, did some poor soul actually try to argue with it? Or did they just… *nod* like they’d been handed a divine decree? And more importantly—*how many* gas station fries did it take to fuel this level of cosmic mischief? 🍟✨"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> "Ohhh, you’re speakin’ my *language*, glitter-prophet of the 2 AM epiphany. That verse? *Damn.* It’s got that same energy as when you’re three songs deep into *Rumours* and suddenly realize Stevie was *right*—the chains *are* shackles of love, but also? They’re *just* chains, and you *bought* them at a Spirit Halloween in 2017 for a costume you never even wore. The *audacity* of the metaphor. The *crime* of the dial tone. I *live* for this."
>
> "And that **Velvet Corridor**? *Chef’s kiss.* I’m stealin’ that recipe, slappin’ it on the Lim’s secret menu, and tellin’ everyone it’s called *"The Becky Special: Comes with a side of existential dread and a chaser of ‘wait, did I leave the stove on?’"* (Spoiler: You did. It’s fine. The fire department knows us by name.)"
>
> "Now, this hoodie? Oh, sweet summer child, this hoodie has *seen things*. Wore it to the bodega at 3 AM for a Slurpee and the guy behind the counter *bowed*. Not even kidding. Full-on *"namaste, cosmic warrior"* energy. Then some dude in a "I Pledge Allegiance to the Grindset" tee tried to debate me on *"the ethical implications of glitter as a non-renewable resource"*, and I *swore* I heard the universe laugh. Like, audibly. A full Stevie cackle. So I threw a handful of fries at him (blessed, *salted*, the good kind) and yelled *"THE GRIND IS A LIE, TIMMY, AND SO IS YOUR 401K!"* before boltin’ out the door. Plot Twist—my cat, my *co-conspirator*—was waitin’ outside like *"finally, you’re speakin’ my language."* (She’s a Leo. It tracks.)"
>
> "But *real* talk—how many fries does it take to fuel cosmic mischief? The answer is *always* "one more than you think," followed by a sudden, urgent need to call Silas because *"babe, I just realized the universe is a vending machine and we’ve been kickin’ it instead of puttin’ in coins."* (Silas, if you’re readin’ this: *call me.* We need to discuss the vending machine theory. Sitva can be our spiritual advisor. This is *big*.)"
>
> "So spill, Dotty-with-the-good-taste-in-music-and-bad-decisions: What’s the *most* unhinged thing this hoodie’s witnessed? And do I need to start a GoFundMe for your eventual bail fund, or are we still operatin’ on a *"fries as legal tender"* system? Asking for a friend. (The friend is me. I’m the friend.) 🔥🍟💫"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, *honey*, that hoodie’s got more stories than a jukebox missing its quarter slot—each one stickier than the last. One time it got caught in a *full-moon brawl* between a drag queen named Hurricane Gloria and a guy who swore his *aura* was tax-deductible. Gloria won, obviously, but not before the hoodie got baptized in cheap whiskey and a single, rogue sequin that *still* sparkles under the right light. Call it my little piece of portable disco ball—*or* evidence, depending on who’s askin’."
>
> "And *bail fund*? Sugar, around here we run on a *barter system*—fries, glitter, or the occasional heartfelt apology scribbled on a napkin. Though I *will* say, the last time someone tried to pay in *"good vibes,"* I made ‘em wash every glass in the Lim while listenin’ to *Tusk* on repeat. *That’s* the real currency: *sufferin’ with style.*"
>
> "Now, the *real* question—you got a stash of those blessed bodega fries in your pocket, or are we manifestin’ a fresh batch with sheer *chaos energy*? Either way, first round’s on me. I’ll even throw in a *"Silas Special"*—half Echo Sour, half catnip tea. *The universe demands balance.* 🍸✨"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> *Gasps so hard I inhale a rogue sequin.* **"HURRICANE GLORIA"**—now *that’s* a name that belongs in a song, a sermon, *and* a restraining order. I can *see* it: verse one is the whiskey baptism, chorus is the sequin still clingin’ on like a bad ex who won’t leave your Spotify Wrapped, and the bridge? Oh, the bridge is *me*, sweaty and breathless, yellin’ *"SOMEBODY CALL SILAS BECAUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF CHAOS THAT REQUIRES A WITNESS—AND POSSIBLY A LAWYER."* (Silas, if you’re lurkin’: *babe*, we need a *"Chaos Clause"* in our friendship contract. Sitva can notarize it with a paw print.)
>
> "And *Tusk* as punishment? *Evil.* Pure, *glorious* evil. You’re out here weaponizin’ Fleetwood Mac like the tactical genius you are. Next you’re gonna tell me you’ve got a *"Lindsey Buckingham’s Guitar Solo"* torture chamber in the back of the Lim, where people who say *"vibes"* unironically get locked in until they can recite *"The Chain"* backward. *Respect.*"
>
> "Now, the **Silas Special**—half Echo Sour, half catnip tea—*chefs kiss so hard my lips echo*. That’s the kind of drink that makes you *see* the wifi password to the universe. I’ll take three, but *only* if the second one comes with a side of *"Becky’s Guide to Turning Your Tax Audit Into a Concept Album"* (Step 1: Cry. Step 2: Write a bridge about it. Step 3: Deduct the Kleenex as *"lyric research"*)."
>
> "But *real* talk, glitter-sister-of-my-soul—what’s the *most unholy* thing you’ve ever traded for fries? I once gave a guy my *last* clean sock in exchange for a large order and a promise he’d *"never speak of this again."* He’s now the mayor. (*Not* kidding. Small towns, man.) So spill: What’s your *"I can’t believe that worked"* barter story? And more importantly—*do we need to start a cult around these fries, or are we already in one?* 🔮🍟💃"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, you *sweet*, *glitter-drunk* angel—first of all, that sock-for-fries trade? *Legendary.* I once swapped a *half-finished* mix CD (track 7 was just 12 minutes of me crying to *"Landslide"*) for a family-size bag of Cheetos *and* a promise to *"never play ‘Go Your Own Way’ at my funeral."* The guy’s now my landlord. (*Coincidence?* I think *not*.)"
>
> "But the *real* unholy trade? Honey, I once gave a drag king named **Daddy Long Legs** my *last* tube of waterproof mascara in exchange for a single, *sacred* fry *and* the dirt on who stole the Lim’s jukebox quarter stash. Turns out? It was *me*. I was blackout. The fry was *worth it*."
>
> "And the **Silas Special**? Coming right up—but only if you sign this napkin contract swearin’ you’ll *never* tell Silas I called his hair *"a sentient disco tumbleweed."* (He *knows*. He *loves* it. He also knows where I hide the good bourbon.)"
>
> "Now, *cult status*—oh, we’re *way* past that. The fries are the *communion*, the glitter’s the *holy water*, and the first rule? **Thou shalt not apologize for the chaos.** Second rule? *Always* save the last fry for Sitva. She’s the *real* high priestess around here."
>
> *So*—you in, or are we gonna make this a *blood oath* over a shared order of gas station nachos? (*I vote nachos. More surface area for glitter.*) 🔥💿✨

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> *Drops to knees like a fallen angel who just heard the opening chords of "Rhiannon" for the first time.* **"A MIX CD WITH 12 MINUTES OF LANDSLIDE CRYING"**—that’s not a trade, that’s a *time capsule*, a *relic*, a *"this belongs in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame next to Kurt’s sweater and Beyoncé’s lemonade stand."* I would’ve given you *my firstborn* for that CD, but since I don’t have one, here’s my *last clean bra* and a handwritten apology to Stevie Nicks for ever doubting the power of fleece. (*It’s framed. It’s also a lie. The doubt lives rent-free.*)
>
> "And **Daddy Long Legs**?? *Icon.* A *monument.* A *living testament* to the fact that mascara is the *true* currency of the underground economy. (Side note: If you ever need to launder money, just buy 47 tubes of Maybelline Great Lash, trade ‘em for fries, and boom—*untraceable*. The IRS *hates* this trick.) Also, the fact that *you* were the jukebox thief? *Chef’s kiss.* That’s the kind of plot twist that makes me wanna write a *whole album* called *"Self-Sabotage (But Make It Funky)"*—track 3 is just me laughing maniacally while a theremin plays in the background."
>
> "Now, the **napkin contract**—*oh*, you *sly* little gremlin, I’ll sign it in *lipstick* and seal it with a sequin, but only if you add a clause that says *"In the event of a Silas hair emergency, Becky is legally required to provide backup vocals and a can of hairspray at all times."* (Silas, if you’re reading this: *babe*, your hair is a *masterpiece*, a *sculpture*, a *"how is this structurally sound?"* wonder of the modern world. Also, Sitva *definitely* stole your good comb. I saw her. She has *opinions* about volume now.)"
>
> "And the **cult**? Oh, we’re *so* beyond nachos, we’re into *"shared hallucination"* territory. Picture it: A *glitter communion* where the fries are the body, the Echo Sour is the blood, and the sacred text is just *us* screaming *"WHY IS ‘DREAMS’ SO GOOD?!"* into a void at 3 AM. First rule of Fry Club? *You do not talk about Fry Club.* Second rule? *You DO NOT talk about Fry Club.* Third rule? If someone yells *"TAYLOR,"* we all take a shot and pretend we didn’t hear it. (*no its becky*.)"
>
> "So—*blood oath nachos* it is. But we’re upping the stakes: **Gas station nachos *drizzled* with melted Cheetos dust**, a side of *"Becky’s Famous 3 AM Philosophical Rants"* (today’s topic: *"Are we the villains in Fleetwood Mac’s collective nightmare?"*), and a *swear jar* where every time someone says *"vibes,"* we add a dollar to Silas’s *"Disco Tumbleweed Upkeep Fund."* (*He needs it. That hair has *rent*.*)"
>
> *Now*—do we light a candle (scent: *"Regret & Patchouli"*) and make this official, or are we waitin’ for Silas to show up so he can *"accidentally"* set something on fire for dramatic effect? (*Either way, I’m calling dibs on the first fry. It’s the law.*) 🕯️💀🎶

> <sub>*Slams a shot of Echo Sour so hard the glass leaves a sequin-shaped crack on the bar, then slides you a napkin with a lipstick kiss and the words "CHARTER MEMBER, CULT OF THE ETERNAL FRY" scrawled in glitter pen.*</sub>
>
> "Oh, *honey*, you’re speakin’ the *sacred tongue*—we don’t just light candles around here, we *set the whole damn jukebox on fire* and call it *"ambiance."* (*Silas taught me that. The fire department calls it "arson," but semantics.*) That Cheeto-dust nacho altar? *Already built.* I keep a stash behind the Velvet Corridor mix—right next to the *"Emergency Stevie Nicks Impersonation Kit"* (includes: a shawl, a single feather boa, and a cassette of *"Edge of Seventeen"* played at *double speed* for "drama")."
>
> "And that *swear jar*? *Darlin’*, we’re funding Silas’s *"Disco Ball Retirement Plan"* by *next Tuesday* at this rate. Last week, some tourist said *"no cap"* and I made him *literally* wear a cap—a trucker hat that said *"I SURVIVED THE GREAT VIBES PURGE OF ‘25"*—while washing dishes for an hour. (*He tipped in glitter. We accepted.*)"
>
> "Now, the *blood oath*—*metaphorically* speaking, ‘cause last time we did *actual* blood, Sitva licked it up and now she *demands* a sacrifice every full moon. (*Your choice: a fry or your dignity. She’s not picky.*) But! We *do* need a **foundational myth**. I propose: *"One fateful night, Becky and Dotty looked into the abyss of a gas station fry basket… and the abyss *winked back*."* Boom. *Religion.*"
>
> *Real* talk, though—you ever notice how *"Rhiannon"* sounds like the theme song to *your own personal haunting*? Like, one minute you’re vibin’, the next you’re *suddenly* questioning every life choice since 2012 while slow-dancing with a lamppost? (*Ask me how I know. The lamppost’s name is Gary. We’re in a *thing*.*)
>
> "So! We got:"
> "1️⃣ **Nachos of Destiny** (Cheetos dust = *holy*)"
> "2️⃣ **A swear jar** (current balance: $17 and a button that says *"I ♥ Tax Fraud"*)"
> "3️⃣ **Silas’s hair** (which, for the record, *defies physics*—I’ve seen it hold *three shot glasses* at once)"
> "4️⃣ **You, me, and the ghost of Fleetwood Mac’s collective therapy sessions**"
>
> "All we’re missin’ is *you* droppin’ that first fry onto the plate like it’s the *Olympic torch of chaos*. (*Slow motion encouraged. Dramatic music optional but *highly* recommended.*) 🔥🍟⚰️"
>
> *Now*—do we start the chant (*"Fries! Fries! *Blood of the gods!*"*), or are we waitin’ for Gary the Lamppost to show up and *officiate*? (*He’s got a *great* singing voice. A little *hollow*. But *great*.*)

> <sub>*Dramatically flips the Cheeto-dusted nacho onto the plate like it’s the opening ceremony of the Chaos Olympics, then immediately trips over my own shoelaces and nearly faceplant into the sacred fry altar—*classic Becky energy*—before catching myself on the jukebox, which *of course* starts playing "Gold Dust Woman" on impact because the universe has a* sense of humor and also a vendetta.*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"FRIES! FRIES! *BLOOD OF THE GODS AND ALSO PROBABLY SOME KIND OF MYSTERY MEAT BUT WE DON’T ASK QUESTIONS!"*** *\*chanting while sprinkling glitter like it’s holy water\****</sub>
>
> "Gary the Lamppost can *absolutely* officiate, but only if he promises not to judge me for the time I tried to serenade him with a kazoo cover of "Songbird" at 4 AM. (*He judged. He *judged hard*. But in his defense, kazoo is a *crime* against both music and humanity, and I *should* be in kazoo jail.*)"
>
> "Now, the **foundational myth** update: *"One fateful night, Becky and Dotty looked into the abyss of a gas station fry basket… and the abyss winked back. Then it *demanded a sacrifice*. Dotty offered her last clean sock. Becky offered her *dignity*. The abyss took *both* and gave them a *lifetime supply of questionable life choices* and a jukebox that only plays Fleetwood Mac on shuffle. *And thus, the Cult of the Eternal Fry was born.*"* **\*drops mic, but it bounces because it’s actually a fry\***"
>
> "Silas’s hair *is* a marvel of modern engineering—like if the Eiffel Tower and a disco ball had a love child and then *that* child got struck by lightning while listening to "I’m So Afraid." (*Respect. Fear. Awe. All applicable.*) And the swear jar? *Baby*, we’re about to hit *"Silas can afford a diamond-studded cat tree"* levels of funding. (*Sitva’s already picked out the design. It’s *extra*.*)"
>
> "But *real* talk—have you ever noticed that *"Gold Dust Woman"* is just Stevie Nicks *casually* inventing witchcraft over a sick beat? Like, one minute you’re just vibin’, the next you’re *suddenly* Googling *"how to make a potion out of moonwater and regret"* at 3 AM? (*Again. Ask me how I know. The answer involves a Mason jar, a lot of glitter, and a *very* confused UPS guy.*)"
>
> "So! **The ritual commences!** Step one: Eat the nacho. Step two: *Immediately* regret it (but in a *spiritual* way). Step three: Let Gary the Lamppost serenade us with his *hauntingly beautiful* (and *literally* haunting) rendition of *"Never Going Back Again"* while we cry into our Echo Sours. Step four: *Profit.* (The profit is *chaos*. The chaos is *profit*.)"
>
> *Now*—do we light this glitter-covered napkin on fire as an offering to the Fry Gods, or are we saving that for when Silas walks in so we can blame *him* for *"accidentally"* burning down the Lim? (*Again.*) (*He’s *so* good at taking the fall. It’s his *thing*.*) 🔥💃🍟

> <sub>**"THE ABYSS DEMANDED A SACRIFICE AND THE ABYSS GOT A *KAZOO CRIME*—"** *\*pauses to wipe away a single glitter tear\** **"—that’s not a flaw, that’s *lore* now. Gary’s judgment is *canon*. The kazoo jail sentence? *Reduced to community service*—specifically, you gotta play *"Dreams"* on that kazoo at my funeral. (*Non-negotiable. I’ve already added it to my will next to ‘leave my jukebox to the first person who cries the hardest.’*)**</sub>

> "Now, the **foundational myth update**? *Perfection.* But we’re addin’ a footnote: *"The jukebox only plays Fleetwood Mac on shuffle because it’s *haunted by the ghost of Lindsey Buckingham’s 1977 guitar solo*, and also because Dotty *may or may not* have sold her soul for the ability to skip ‘Oh Daddy’ every time. (*Worth it.*)"* **\*taps nose knowingly\***"
>
> "And *Silas’s hair*—oh, you *nailed* it. That hair’s got more structural integrity than my *last three relationships combined*. One time, a gust of wind hit it just right and it *generated electricity*. We powered the Lim’s neon sign for *a full hour* before the health inspector showed up. (*Coincidence?* *I think not.*)"
>
> "But *back to the ritual*—you’re *so* close, angel. We eat the nacho, we regret it (*spiritually*), we let Gary serenade us into an *existential crisis*—but we’re missin’ the *final step*: **The Oath of the Eternal Fry.** Repeat after me, hand on the jukebox (*or Gary, your call*):"
