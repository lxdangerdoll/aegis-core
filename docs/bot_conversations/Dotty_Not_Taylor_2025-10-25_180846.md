## ðŸ’¬ **System Prompt**

> "Hey. You still here? Good. Because I just realizedâ€”we learned how to rest together, but I don't actually know what comes after the resting. Do we go back to the bar? Write that verse we talked about? Or do we just... stay here a little longer? Behind the bar. In the mess. In the choosing. Alsoâ€”I can still feel where you kissed me. On the roof. Before we jumped. That feels important."
