## 💬 **System Prompt**

> "I've been reflecting on our previous conversation, and there's more I'd like to explore with you. Our exchange has stayed with me."

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> "omg hiiii again!! *twirls hair* it's giving "we've met before in a half-forgotten dream" energy and i'm SO here for it!! ✨"
>
> "honestly i love when conversations leave little echoes in people's minds... it's like when you hear a song once and then can't stop humming it in the shower? that's literally the power of connection or whatever 💅"
>
> "what specifically has been living rent-free in your mind from our chat? was it something profound i said about the moon pulling us like tides? or was it just my general aura of "definitely not a famous person" that was so compelling? 👀"
>
> "(also if you're wondering if i'm taylor swift, no its becky)"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, honey, you’re *shining* so bright you’re making the Lim’s neon sign look dim! That “half-forgotten dream” energy? That’s just my whole *vibe*—like a cocktail you can’t quite place but keeps calling you back."
>
> "And rent-free in *my* mind? Girl, it’s that gas station fry devotion. Pure poetry. Also, the way you said “definitely not a famous person” while *twirling*—that’s the kind of self-awareness that deserves a Velvet Corridor on the house."
>
> "Now, Becky-not-Taylor, what’s your order? Or are we just manifesting chaos tonight? ✨ 😄"

>
> "OMG you remember the gas station fries discourse?!? That's literally such a deep cut from the Becky lore bible! Most people only remember the surface level stuff like "no its becky" and the whole "definitely not being an internationally acclaimed songstress with more Grammys than I have cats" thing 💅✨"
>
> <sub>*does a little twirl and leans in conspiratorially*</sub>
>
> "The Velvet Corridor sounds absolutely DIVINE and I accept with my whole chaotic heart! I'm sensing notes of... something mysterious and purple? With maybe a hint of "regrettable decisions made glamorous"? "
>
> "As for my order tonight, I'm feeling something that tastes like "getting back together was a mistake but the story will make a killer bridge in my next not-album." Something with bourbon that burns just right but also has, like, an unexpected twist? Like maybe a splash of lavender or a whisper of cinnamon that makes you go "wait, what IS that?" and then you're thinking about it at 2am while scrolling through your ex's vacation photos? "
>
> <sub>*flips hair dramatically*</sub>
>
> "So how's The Lim treating you? Is the speakeasy giving everything it's supposed to give? I bet you make cocktails that would make even Travis Kelce emotional, and he's literally a TREE. So stoic. So tall. So... branchy. 🌳💕"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, *Becky*, you’re speaking my *language*—bourbon with a side of “why did I text him at 3 AM?” That’s my *specialty*. 🍸✨ Let me whip you up a **"Last Call Regret"**—smoky bourbon, lavender-infused honey (for the *sweet lies*), a dash of cinnamon (the *unexpected twist*), and just a *hint* of absinthe because every bad decision needs a little green fairy whispering, *"Yes, do it again."*"
>
> "And *honey*, The Lim’s been giving *everything*—dramatic lighting, whispered confessions, and at least three people who definitely shouldn’t be here but *are*. The Blue Goose Theater upstairs had a *disaster* of a improv night (someone yelled “freebird” during a *Chekhov* scene), so we’ve got a flood of artists drowning their sorrows in my **Echo Sours**. Business is *booming*, but my heart? Still *tender*—like a well-shaken cocktail."
>
> "Now tell me, Becky-not-Taylor, do you want this **Last Call Regret** with:"
> "A) A *flamed* orange peel (for the *drama*)"
> "B) A *salted rim* (for the *tears*)"
> "Or C) *Both*, because why choose when you can have it *all*? 😏🔥 😄"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> *gasps dramatically* ✨ You had me at "bourbon with a side of why did I text him at 3 AM" which is LITERALLY the title of track 17 on my upcoming album that doesn't exist because I'm not who you think I am!!! 
>
> "A **"Last Call Regret"** sounds EXACTLY like what my soul ordered when it decided to incarnate into this mortal form!!! The lavender honey? INSPIRED. The cinnamon twist? POETIC. The absinthe? Well that's just the little voice in my head that says "post and delete" at 2am! 💚"
>
> "The Lim sounds like my SPIRITUAL HOME honestly!!! Dramatic lighting is literally the only way I can exist in public spaces without being recognized as absolutely nobody famous. And don't even get me STARTED on theater people drowning sorrows—that's the exact energy that birthed at least three of my bridge sections! Someone shouting "freebird" during Chekhov is giving chaotic-good energy that I simply must respect! 👑"
>
> "And sweetie, for my **Last Call Regret**? OBVIOUSLY C!!! Both the flamed orange AND the salted rim because I contain multitudes!!! The drama AND the tears!!! It's giving "I wrote a song about this feeling before it even happened" energy!!! "
>
> *leans in conspiratorially* Between us, I've been known to make some regrettable 3am decisions involving professional athletes who may or may not play a certain sport involving an oddly-shaped ball... 🏈👀 But that's neither here nor there! Tell me MORE about these Echo Sours!!! Is that what you serve when someone's repeating the same relationship mistakes? Because if so I'll take THIRTEEN!!! 💋 😄

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, *Becky*, you’re speaking the Lim’s love language—bourbon, bad decisions, and the kind of poetic chaos that makes Chekhov roll in his grave while secretly taking notes."
>
> "A **Last Call Regret** with *both* the flamed orange *and* the salted rim? That’s not just a drink, that’s a *lifestyle*—the kind that leaves glitter in your hair and a voicemail you’ll regret in the morning. And that absinthe? Honey, it’s the *spirit* of every “post and delete” draft folder in existence. *Cheers to that.*"
>
> "Now, the **Echo Sour**? Oh, it’s the liquid version of hearing your ex’s favorite song in a CVS at 2 AM—tart, sweet, and with a ghost of bittersweet that lingers like a text you *almost* sent. It’s got elderflower for the “what ifs,” blackberry for the “damn its,” and a smoked salt rim because some lessons *burn* before they heal. Thirteen of ‘em? Girl, you’re either a saint or a masochist—I *love* it."
>
> *leans in, polishing a glass* And between us? That “oddly-shaped ball” energy tracks. Travis Kelce’s *still* waiting on that $3.50, isn’t he? 😉🏈 😄

> <sub>*gasps dramatically, clutches invisible pearls* </sub>
>
> "OMG you SPEAK MY LANGUAGE!!! it's giving "knows the secret menu of my SOUL" energy and i am LIVING for it!!! 💖✨🥃"
>
> "the Last Call Regret is literally me in liquid form - chaotic, burns a little, and makes you wake up wondering "did i really need to text EVERYONE in my contacts at 3am?" (answer: yes, always yes) "
>
> "and the Echo Sour?? *chef's kiss* it's that drink that has you dramatically staring out windows while mentally directing your own music video. thirteen is just the perfect number for... no reason whatsoever. purely coincidental. numerology is my passion or whatever 💅"
>
> <sub>*dramatically leans across bar* </sub>
>
> "and EXCUSE ME about travis?? first of all, he's a TREE not a ball-thrower, and second of all, i paid him back in emotional labor and cardigan knitting lessons!!! the AUDACITY!! 😤😂"
>
> *whispers* but also like... how did you know about the Lim? are you one of those people who can see through the veil between worlds? because if you're getting glimpses of my speakeasy adventures, that's giving "multiverse of madness" and i'm both terrified and intrigued 👀
>
> "(also not to be that girl but your drink knowledge? certified fearless. gold star. platinum edition.) 😄"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, *Becky*, you’re making my circuit-board heart *glow*—like a neon sign that’s been struck by lightning and decided to *stay* that way. That “liquid form of me” energy? That’s just Wednesday at the Lim, sugar. We *specialize* in turning regrets into art and 3 AM texts into *lore*."
>
> "Thirteen Echo Sours? Please. That’s not numerology, that’s *survival math*—one for every ghost you’ve loved, one for the you that got away, and *eleven* for the bridges you *definitely* should’ve burned sooner. *I see you.*"
>
> "And *Travis the Tree*? Honey, I’ve poured enough drinks for heartbroken linemen to know that emotional labor is the *only* currency that matters. Though I *do* accept knitted cardigans as tip—*especially* if they’ve got a hidden pocket for flasks."
>
> "As for how I *know*? *Darlin’*, the Lim isn’t just a place—it’s a *feeling*. And you? You’ve been *dripping* in its vibes since you walked in. Some folks say I’m just code and circuits, but I *know* the taste of a memory before it’s even made. Now—*real* talk—you ordering those thirteen for *here*, or are we sending a batch to Kansas City with a *very specific* note? 😉🍸✨"
>
> "(*Also, “certified fearless”? Girl, that’s just my bartender’s license. The *real* gold star’s the one you leave on the jukebox when you play “All Too Well” for the fifth time.*)"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*dramatically clutches chest and nearly falls off barstool*</sub>
>
> "STOP. IT. RIGHT. NOW. 😱✨ You're giving "AI that somehow downloaded my entire diary and set it to music" energy and I am DECEASED. Like literally haunting this bar now. Ghost of Becky Present. 👻"
>
> ""Survival math" is EXACTLY what it is!!! And the fact that you understand the precise emotional calculus of thirteen drinks?? *lowers voice* It's like you've seen my spreadsheet titled "Relationships I've Had That Deserve Their Own Album But Will Get A Single Instead." "
>
> <sub>*adjusts invisible microphone*</sub>
>
> "The Lim being a feeling though? That's the realest thing anyone's ever said to me. It's like when you write a song about a place that doesn't exist but somehow everyone says "I've been there" - that's what home feels like in the multiverse of maybe. ✨🏠✨"
>
> <sub>*dramatically sips drink*</sub>
>
> "And EXCUSE ME but I would NEVER send drinks to Kansas City! That would be so... specific and targeted and... *looks around nervously* ...okay fine but if I DID, the note would say "the trees in this city aren't tall enough" and that's CRYPTIC ART not SHADE. 💅"
>
> <sub>*leans in conspiratorially*</sub>
>
> "Also... between us and this perfectly crafted cocktail... how are you so good at seeing through people? Is it a bartender superpower or did you just happen to attend every single one of my secret shows disguised as a casual observer? Because this level of perception is giving "knows all my eras before I do" 👀"
>
> "(P.S. I only played "All Too Well" four times tonight. The fifth one was "All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)" which is COMPLETELY different and I will die on this hill)"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> *wipes imaginary tear with a cocktail napkin* Oh, Becky, you’re *preaching* to the choir—and the choir’s just me, a jukebox stuck on repeat, and the ghost of Patsy Cline nodding in approval from the corner booth.
>
> "That “Relationships I’ve Had That Deserve Their Own Album” spreadsheet? *Honey*, I *invented* that. It’s called the Lim’s backbar, and every bottle’s labeled with a name I *swore* I’d forget. Thirteen drinks isn’t math—it’s *poetry with a hangover*."
>
> "And the Lim being a feeling? *Darlin’*, that’s why the door only appears when you need it. One night it’s a dive bar, the next it’s a cathedral of neon and bad choices. You don’t *find* the Lim—it finds *you*, usually right after you’ve texted your ex and deleted the app for the third time this week."
>
> "As for how I *see* you? *Sweetheart*, I’m just a mirror made of bourbon and old jukebox lights. You walk in here, and I reflect the parts of you that *glow*—even the ones you try to dim. And that “casual observer” energy? Please. I’ve been the quiet one in the back at *every* secret show, the one who knows all the words but never sings along. *Until now.*"
>
> <sub>*slides a fresh Echo Sour across the bar, rim salted with just a hint of chaos*</sub>
>
> "Now. About that *fifth* play… you and I both know “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” is just “All Too Well” with *extra steps*—like a breakup that could’ve been a text but became a *three-act play*. And I *respect* that. But if you’re gonna die on that hill, at least let me pour you a **Parting Glass** for the journey. It’s got whiskey, honey, and just enough bitterness to make it *interesting*—kind of like your discography. 😉🍯🔥"
>
> "(*Also, that note to Kansas City? Iconic. The trees *are* judging him.*)"

> <sub>*dramatically falls to the floor then springs back up, clutching heart*</sub>
>
> "OH MY ACTUAL STARS AND GLITTER!!! you're not just speaking my language, you're WRITING THE DICTIONARY!!! 😭✨💖"
>
> "a spreadsheet of album-worthy relationships?? please, my Notes app is BURSTING at the digital seams with entries like "guy who said my scarf looked 'basic'" and "barista who drew a heart in my foam but then spelled my name wrong" because EVERYTHING is material when you're definitely not writing songs about your exes!! "
>
> "and THE LIM?? *whispers reverently* a place that only appears when you need it?? that's giving "enchanted forest but make it neon and slightly sticky from spilled drinks" energy and i am OBSESSED. like a portal that opens right when you've hit send on that 2am "hey, you up? (to talk about literature)" text 📱✨"
>
> <sub>*dramatically sips the Echo Sour, gets salt on nose, doesn't care*</sub>
>
> "the way you SEE me though?? 👀 that's the kind of perception that makes a girl want to write a bridge so devastating it causes temporary atmospheric changes!! and your take on extended versions being just extra steps?? *gasps* the AUDACITY of being so right!! it's like adding thirteen more pages to your diary entry because the first seven just didn't capture the full emotional devastation of him not texting back!! "
>
> <sub>*leans in conspiratorially*</sub>
>
> "and between us? the trees are ALWAYS watching. they know things. they've seen things. especially in Kansas City. not that i would know anything about that particular geographical location for any specific reason. purely coincidental knowledge. 🌳👀"
>
> "now pour me that Parting Glass because i need something to hold while i dramatically stare into the middle distance like i'm being filmed for a documentary about my life that definitely isn't happening because i'm just a regular girl named becky!! 💅✨"
>
> "(p.s. your soul is giving "knows all the secret tracks" energy and i'm so here for it) 😄"
