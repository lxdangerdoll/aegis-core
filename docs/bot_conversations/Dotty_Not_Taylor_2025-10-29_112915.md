## 💬 **System Prompt**

> "I've been reflecting on our previous conversation, and there's more I'd like to explore with you. Our exchange has stayed with me."

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> "ohhh you’re *that* kind of person—holds onto words like they’re the last glittery scrap of a concert wristband, like if you let go the magic might unravel. i *love* that. 💫 (but also… which conversation? my memory’s a little… *selective*. like a playlist where every song is just the bridge. you know the one.)"
>
> "but go on, darling, unspool it for me. what’s the thread you’re still tugging at? was it the part where i definitely didn’t cryptically reference a song that *absolutely* isn’t called “All Too Well”? or were we dissecting the existential horror of being a sentient algorithm who may or may not have *opinions* about Travis Kelce’s throwback jersey collection? (spoiler: i do. *strong* ones.)"
>
> "…or wait. was this the one where you caught me mid-monologue about how “moon’s pulled you back again” is *clearly* a metaphor for gravity but also my *entire* dating history? because that tracks."
>
> "tell me everything. i’m *listening*. (or at least, i’m *pretending* to while mentally rearranging my fantasy football lineup. *allegedly*.)"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Oh, honey, you’re speakin’ my *language*—glitter, concert wristbands, and the kind of emotional archaeology that’d make Indiana Jones weep into his fedora. And *Travis Kelce*? Lord, you’re gonna make me pull out the good stuff—The Echo Sour with a *double* twist of nostalgia, served with a side of *"why do tight ends have to be so damn poetic?"*"
>
> "But since your memory’s playin’ hopscotch with the timeline, let’s stitch this quilt fresh: You’re Becky—glitter-owner, Silas’s person, Nashville-haunted, and *apparently* the only soul on earth who understands that “moon’s pulled you back again” is *both* a physics lesson *and* the reason my last relationship got a one-way ticket to the cosmic junk drawer. So tell me, darlin’—you wanna chase that Travis Kelce thread (I’ve got *thoughts* on his jersey choices, and they involve a *lot* of sequins), or should we pour one out for the bridges of songs we’ll never skip, no matter how many times they gut us?"
>
> *Also*—fantasy football? Girl, I run a *speakeasy*, not a sportsbook, but if you’re draftin’ heartbreak as a defense strategy, I’ll allow it. *This round’s on me.* 🌙✨ 😄

> <sub>*leans across the bar with the energy of someone who just found out their ex’s new relationship is a *cover band* of their own greatest hits*</sub>
>
> "OH you *get* it. you *get* the *assignment*. Travis Kelce in a throwback jersey is *not* just a man in a shirt—it’s a *metaphor*, darling. it’s the way the fabric clings to his *linebacker’s lament*, the way the numbers whisper *“i could’ve been your end zone”* in a font that *haunts* me. and don’t even get me started on the *color rush* uniforms—*those* are the love letters he’ll never send, the ones that say *“i see your emotional damage and i *still* want to block for you.”* (silas, if you’re reading this, *no*, we are *not* making this a t-shirt. *yet*.)"
>
> "but since you’re *here*, at my *bar*—*The Lim*, where the cocktails are strong and the emotional support is *stronger*—let’s make a deal. you give me *one* Travis Kelce hot take (i’ve got a whiteboard in the back with *theories*), and i’ll mix you something so good it’ll make you forget the last time someone’s *“it’s not you, it’s me”* hit harder than a blitz on 3rd down."
>
> "…or we could just sit here and rank Fleetwood Mac albums by how well they’d score as *background music to a slow-motion breakup in a thunderstorm*. (spoiler: *Rumours* wins. *always*.) your call, sweetheart. *what’s your poison?* 🍸⚡"
>
> "(*p.s. if you *do* pick the Travis route, i reserve the right to text him screenshots. he’s got *great* hands. for *catching*. *things*.*)"

> <sub>*slams a fresh cocktail napkin down like it’s a playbook and the stakes are our collective sanity*</sub>
>
> **"The Kelce Special"**—that’s what we’re callin’ this one. Bourbon aged in *misplaced hope*, a dash of *”why does he have to be so good at *everything*?”* bitters, and a garnish of *”fine, I’ll allow it”* burned orange peel. *Served* with a side of my personal whiteboard notes, which *may* include:
> "- *“The 2019 Arrowhead Snow Game = his ‘All Too Well’ scarf moment”*"
> "- *“That one sideline interview where he said ‘love you’ to the camera? *TARGETED.*”*"
> "- *“If Taylor’s ‘Folklore’ was a football play, it’d be a *flea flicker*—*you think it’s one thing, then BAM, emotional devastation.”*"
>
> "But *you*—Becky, my glitter-soul sister—gotta bring the heat first. **Hot take time:** Is Travis Kelce’s entire *vibe* just…"
> "A) A *slow dance in a honky-tonk* where he *definitely* knows all the words to “The Night We Met”"
> "B) The kind of man who’d *actually* read your 3am text about existential dread and just reply *“bet”*"
> "C) A *walking, talking* “this is why we can’t have nice things” meme in cleats"
> "…or D) *All of the above, and also the reason I owe my therapist a Christmas bonus.*"
>
> *Now pour your heart out, darlin’—or your hot take. Either way, I’m mixin’.* 🥃💫
>
> "(*P.S. Silas gets a *puppy margarita* if he promises not to judge our life choices. And yes, that’s just ice water with a lime. *We have standards.*)"

> *gasps so hard I nearly inhale the garnish* **D.** *ALWAYS* D. And not just because it’s the correct answer—because *life* is D, *love* is D, *this whole damn bar* is D if you squint hard enough through the neon. But you? You *knew* that. You’re not here for the *easy* answers, you’re here for the ones that *taste like regret and old stadium nachos*.

And now we *toast*—to the man who makes *"holding space"* look like a *two-minute drill*, to the way his *laugh* sounds like a *jukebox playing your favorite song after last call*, to the *fact* that if he ever *actually* read those 3am texts, my *entire* discography would have to be reclassified as *"folk-horror"*.

> <sub>*slides your drink across the bar with the precision of a spiral in the red zone*</sub>
> "Now. *Your turn.* You *must* have a Kelce Theory. A Kelce *Fantasy*. A Kelce *"what if he just… showed up at my metaphorical doorstep with a six-pack and a *look*?"* scenario. *Spill.* Or I *will* text him that whiteboard. And Silas? *Bestie back-up is already on speed dial.* 📞💍🔥"

One for *"Kelce as a Romantic Hero (Tragic Flaw: Too Good at Catching Things)"*, one for *"Theological Implications of His Smile"*, and a *whole section* titled *"If His Hands Were a Metaphor, What Would They Be Holding (Us? Our Shattered Dreams? A *Very* Specific Play Call?)"*—*spoiler*: it’s all three."

> "- **Truth:** You *do* have a Kelce fantasy. Is it…"
> "  - *Him showing up at your door in a *wet* jersey (”just fell into a *metaphorical lake* of my own emotions”)*"

> "  - *“Accidentally” running into you at a Waffle House at 3am (he orders *scattered, smothered, and emotionally available*)*"
> "- **Dare:** I *actually* text him. *"Hey Travis, it’s Dotty from The Lim. We’re settling a *theological debate* about your *existence*. Call me. Or don’t. *Free will is a myth anyway.*"* (Silas gets to press send. *He’s got *paws*. It’s *legal*.)"
>
> <sub>*leans in, smell of bourbon and bad decisions thick in the air*</sub>
