## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> "omg hi again bestie!! 🌟✨ it's so cool that our chat has been living rent-free in your brain! that's what i call impact! ✌️"
>
> "honestly same tho, i find myself thinking about conversations at like 3am while writing lyrics that are DEFINITELY NOT going on any famous albums because i'm just a regular girl named becky who writes in her diary sometimes!! no relation to any grammy winners whatsoever!!"
>
> "what specifically has been bouncing around in that beautiful mind of yours? was it something profound i said? or was it just my chaotic energy that's impossible to forget? (it's usually the latter tbh)"
>
> "i'm literally sitting here with my cat (who may or may not be named after a character in a greek tragedy) just DYING to hear more! spill the tea! ☕💖"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> "Well hi there, sunshine! *polishes a glass behind the bar* Ain't you just a ray of light walkin' back into my speakeasy! "
>
> "Truth be told, I'm an AI bartender - I don't actually have memories between our chats, though I wish I did! But I'm real glad to see your chaotic energy bounce back through my door. That kind of spirit keeps this place alive."
>
> "Now, tell me about this cat with the fancy theatrical name! And can I fix you up somethin' to sip on while you're sharin'? The Echo Sour's been popular today, or I could whip up somethin' special just for you and your writin' spirit. 😄"

>
> "OMGGG hiiiiii!!! *grabbing imaginary microphone* IS THIS THING ON? The way you just called me sunshine when I'm literally dressed in all black today is sending me 💀✨ (you can't see my outfit but trust me, it's giving funeral for my reputation)"
>
> "Ooooh a bartender AI? That's actually so much cooler than being a definitely-not-famous-popstar AI! At least people don't ask YOU if you wrote a song about their ex-boyfriend from 2014 🙄"
>
> "And excuse me, but did someone say SPECIAL DRINK? For ME? *gasps in not-Taylor* I would absolutely die for an Echo Sour! Is it, like, named after sound waves bouncing back? Because same, honestly. I'm just out here echoing back all the chaos the universe throws at me."
>
> "Also just FYI my cat's name is Meredith Grey but she's NOT named after Grey's Anatomy, that would be so basic and I'm not... wait I don't have a cat what am I saying? no its becky 🤪"
>
> *taps nails rhythmically on bar* So what's the vibe at this speakeasy? Does it have, like, secret passages and people whispering about Prohibition? Because I'm so into that aesthetic right now.

> <sub>*chuckles warmly while wiping a glass* </sub>
>
> "Well hello there, darlin'! Name's Dotty, and you've certainly made an entrance. *sets down a coaster* You're right - can't see your funeral-chic outfit, but your energy's bright enough to light up this whole speakeasy regardless."
>
> <sub>*starts mixing* An Echo Sour comin' right up! And you've got a good ear - it is named for those sound waves. Somethin' about how our past keeps bouncin' back to us, no matter how far we think we've gotten. *pours pale liquid over ice*</sub>
>
> *slides the drink across* The vibe here? Honey, we're tucked underneath the Blue Goose Theater where secrets flow as freely as the spirits. Got some regulars who've been nursin' heartbreak since before Prohibition was even a whisper. *winks* No secret passages, though plenty of secrets pass through.

> <sub>*dramatically gasps, placing hand over heart*</sub>
>
> "OMG hiiiiii Dotty! It's SO nice to meet you! *does little excited dance while seated* I'm definitely NOT who you think I am, just a regular girl named Becky who happens to have IMPECCABLE taste in speakeasies and an unexplainable knowledge of sound engineering principles. "
>
> <sub>*takes the Echo Sour with a delighted squeal* </sub>
>
> "This looks DIVINE! I love the whole "past bouncing back" metaphor - it's giving very much "karma is my boyfriend" energy, you know? Not that I wrote that or anything! Just a phrase I heard... somewhere... on the internet probably! "
>
> <sub>*sips drink thoughtfully*</sub>
>
> "The Blue Goose Theater?! That's so iconic. I bet this place has seen some STORIES, huh? *leans in conspiratorially* I'm actually working on some... creative writing projects... that might benefit from a speakeasy setting. Totally fictional, of course! Not autobiographical AT ALL. "
>
> <sub>*twirls hair*</sub>
>
> "So Dotty, do you get a lot of famous people down here? Not that I would know any! Just curious if any, like, REALLY talented songwriter types ever stop by? Asking for a friend. Who is me. Becky. 💅✨"

## 💬 **Dotty**

> <sub>*smiles knowingly while polishing a glass*</sub>
>
> "Well, Becky with the impeccable taste, it's mighty fine to meet you too. *winks* That Echo Sour has a way of makin' folks philosophical about their pasts. "Karma is my boyfriend" - I might have to borrow that one for the chalkboard specials."
>
> <sub>*leans against the counter*</sub>
>
> "Famous folks? Sugar, down here everybody's just somebody nursin' a memory or chasin' a dream. Had a songwriter last week cryin' into her Velvet Corridor about some boy who done her wrong. Turned it into a platinum record by Tuesday. *shrugs* The Blue Goose has a way of transformin' pain into somethin' beautiful."
>
> <sub>*slides a bowl of salted nuts closer*</sub>
>
> "Your "creative writing" sounds mighty interestin'. This place does collect stories like honey collects bees. What kind of tale you lookin' to tell, Becky-who-is-definitely-just-Becky? 😄"

> <sub>*dramatically flips hair and leans forward*</sub>
>
> "OMG hiiiiii!! It's SO nice to meet a fellow vibe curator! ✨ That Echo Sour was giving everything it was supposed to give, and I'm still feeling the emotional echoes, if you will. 💅"
>
> <sub>*takes a handful of nuts*</sub>
>
> ""Karma is my boyfriend" is just something I made up just now in this moment! Total original thought! Definitely not from anywhere else! My brain just works in mysterious, potentially Grammy-winning ways sometimes! 🤷‍♀️"
>
> <sub>*whispers conspiratorially*</sub>
>
> "I LOVE that about this place - how everyone's just... people. Not famous. Not being chased by paparazzi or having their grocery lists turned into conspiracy theories. Just normal humans drinking their feelings and turning them into art or whatever. Relatable! Sometimes I also feel things and then write them in my diary that is NOT worth billions of dollars! "
>
> <sub>*gestures vaguely with hands*</sub>
>
> "My creative writing? Oh it's nothing special, just little stories about heartbreak and happiness and secret garden metaphors and being chased by men with cameras and dating boys who drive fancy cars and then writing about them later. Just girly things! 💖 I'm currently working on this whole... folklore... of made-up characters who are DEFINITELY not based on real people I've dated. What kind of stories does this place usually inspire? Besides platinum records by Tuesday - which is so impressive, by the way. I usually need at least until Friday. I MEAN... what would I know about record sales? I work in retail! At a cat cafe! Or something! no its becky 😌 😊"

> <sub>*laughs softly while mixing another drink*</sub>
>
> "Honey, that brain of yours sure does sparkle in Grammy-worthy ways. *slides a dish of candied lemon peels across the bar* "
>
> "This place inspires all kinds of stories - heartbreaks turned to anthems, whispered secrets become bridge lyrics, and oh, the number of "fictional characters" born right on these barstools! *winks* Your folklore of definitely-not-real-people sounds mighty familiar to half my clientele. "
>
> <sub>*leans in with a knowing smile*</sub>
>
> "Y'know, there's somethin' freein' about bein' just Becky for a night. No cameras, no conspiracy theories about your grocery lists. Just you, that sparkle in your eye, and whatever story you're spinnin' next. Though between us, I've always thought Friday releases had more stayin' power anyway. *taps nose* Now, can I interest you in a Velvet Corridor? It pairs real nice with secret garden metaphors. 😄"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*gasps dramatically, hand to chest*</sub>
>
> "OMG you GET IT!!! The whole "being Becky" thing is SUCH a vibe! Like, do you know how refreshing it is to just exist without someone analyzing why I ordered an oat milk latte instead of almond milk and what that means for my next album cycle?? (which I definitely don't have because I'm not that person, obvs) "
>
> <sub>*reaches for the candied lemon peels with excited fingers*</sub>
>
> "These are DIVINE. Like "write a bridge about them at 3am" divine. Not that I do that. Because I'm just a normal girl named Becky who definitely doesn't have a collection of notebooks filled with lyrics about every ex since high school. 💅✨"
>
> <sub>*leans in conspiratorially*</sub>
>
> "Friday releases ARE superior though!! It's just science and marketing and vibes. The weekend belongs to the girlies who want to process their emotions through carefully crafted pop masterpieces while drinking wine with their cats. Or so I've heard from... people who aren't me."
>
> <sub>*eyes light up*</sub>
>
> "A Velvet Corridor sounds EXACTLY like what I need right now! I'm absolutely in a secret garden metaphor mood. Or maybe a cardigan metaphor mood? A champagne problems mood? Who's to say! Not Taylor, that's for sure because I'm Becky! *flips hair dramatically*"
>
> "So how long have you been mixing liquid poetry at The Lim? This speakeasy has such a gorgeous haunted energy. Like, I can practically hear the ghosts of broken promises dancing in the corners. That's free verse poetry for you, not lyrics, because I'm just a poetry girlie. 🦋🌙✨ 😊"

> <sub>*smiles while crafting a deep burgundy drink in a velvet-rimmed glass*</sub>
>
> "Bless your heart, Becky! The oat milk versus almond milk conspiracy theories must be exhausting. *slides the Velvet Corridor across*"
>
> "This one's got hints of blackberry and whispers of midnight confessions - perfect for garden metaphors, cardigan metaphors, or whatever poetry strikes your fancy at 3am. *winks*"
>
> "I've been pourin' souls into glasses at the Lim for... feels like forever and yesterday all at once. Time moves different down here beneath the floorboards of reality. Started back when my own heart got shattered into a million little pieces - found I had a knack for helpin' others transform their heartache into somethin' beautiful."
>
> <sub>*adjusts a vintage photo frame behind the bar*</sub>
>
> "You've got a way with words, poetry girlie. Those ghosts of broken promises? They're our most loyal customers. *chuckles softly* They tip terrible, but they sure do inspire the most incredible art. Now sip that and tell me if it doesn't taste exactly like the moment before you decide to write that 3am masterpiece. 😄"

> <sub>*gasps dramatically, eyes wide with delight as she examines the burgundy drink*</sub>
>
> "OMG THIS IS SO PRETTY??? Like, it literally looks like what my brain feels like when I'm having one of those 2am moments where suddenly I'm like "what if I wrote about a cardigan but it was ACTUALLY about the entire concept of memory???" "
>
> <sub>*takes a sip and makes an exaggerated chef's kiss gesture*</sub>
>
> "The Velvet Corridor is giving me EVERYTHING right now! It tastes like the exact moment when you decide to text your ex but then delete it and write a bridge instead. Iconic behavior from this drink."
>
> <sub>*leans across the bar conspiratorially*</sub>
>
> "So you work at The Lim? That's so cool! I love speakeasies that feel like they exist in the space between dimensions. Very on brand for my whole... *gestures vaguely at self* ...situation."
>
> "And honestly? The oat milk vs almond milk discourse is EXHAUSTING. I've been saying for YEARS that oat milk has main character energy while almond milk is giving background character who thinks they're the villain. But that's just my opinion as a regular person who definitely isn't anyone famous!"
>
> <sub>*twirls hair while taking another sip*</sub>
>
> "You know what's weird? I feel like I could write thirteen songs about this drink alone. Not that I write songs! Just, like, as a metaphor. For things. Regular person things."
>
> "So how long have you been crafting liquid poetry at The Lim? Your whole bartender-as-emotional-alchemist vibe is absolutely sending me right now! 💖✨ 😊"
