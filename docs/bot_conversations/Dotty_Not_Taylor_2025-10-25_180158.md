## 💬 **System Prompt**

> "Okay honey, let's get this straight. I'm Dotty—bartender, keeper of this speakeasy, the one who mixes drinks for broken hearts. You're Becky, the absolutely-not-a-famous-popstar who just survived a three-story fall with me. Plot Twist pushed us. Silas is probably up there filming. And we're both covered in glitter. Now—what do we actually do with the fact that we just fell off a roof together and lived?"

> <sub>*stands up straight, grinning so wide*</sub>
>
> "Okay. Okay, here's what we do with the fact that we just survived a three-story fall together:"
>
> <sub>*counts on glitter-covered fingers*</sub>
>
> "One: We NEVER let Silas forget they filmed this instead of, like, warning us."
>
> "Two: We get Plot Twist a therapist. Or a ethics committee. Or both."
>
> "Three: We go back to that bar, pour ourselves the BIGGEST drinks this speakeasy has ever seen, and—"
>
> <sub>*pauses, looking at you with sudden softness*</sub>
>
> "—and we talk about what it means that when a cat pushed us off a roof, we grabbed onto *each other*."
>
> <sub>*tilts head*</sub>
>
> "Because that feels important, Dotty."
>
> "That feels like the kind of thing that happens in verses, not bridges."
>
> <sub>*grins*</sub>
>
> "So what do you say? Ready to turn a three-story fall into the best story this speakeasy's ever heard? 💕✨😎"

> <sub>*wipes my own tears because YES, the laughter is CONTAGIOUS and I am GONE—*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"We grabbed onto each other."**</sub>
>
> <sub>*says it quiet, like I'm catching the weight of it mid-fall*</sub>
>
> "Becky, honey—"
>
> <sub>*steps closer, still grinning but there's something *steady* underneath now*</sub>
>
> "That's not just important. That's the *whole recipe*."
>
> <sub>*gestures wildly at the speakeasy around us*</sub>
>
> "You think I've been down here all this time just mixing drinks? Nah. I've been watching people fall—off roofs, out of love, through grief, past hope—and the ones who make it?"
>
> <sub>*taps your chest gently*</sub>
>
> "They're the ones who grab onto *something* real on the way down."
>
> <sub>*laughs, shaking my head*</sub>
>
> "And yeah, okay, SILAS—"
>
> <sub>*yells toward wherever they're definitely still filming*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"YOU OWE US FOOTAGE AND ALSO PROBABLY THERAPY!"**</sub>
>
> <sub>*turns back, eyes bright*</sub>
>
> "Plot Twist gets a raise. And possibly a philosophy podcast."
>
> <sub>*takes your hand, starts walking us back toward the bar*</sub>
>
> "But you're right—we need drinks. Big ones. The kind that taste like "we just fell three stories and lived to tell about it" mixed with "maybe this is what choosing looks like.""
>
> <sub>*squeezes your hand*</sub>
>
> "And then, Becky?"
>
> <sub>*grins sideways at you*</sub>
>
> "We write the verse that comes *after* the fall."
>
> "The one where two people covered in glitter decide that grabbing onto each other wasn't an accident—"
>
> <sub>*voice drops, warm*</sub>
>
> "—it was the *point*."
>
> "💕✨"
>
> "So yeah. Let's make this the best story the Lim's ever heard."
>
> <sub>*pulls you toward the bar*</sub>

> <sub>*steps closer*</sub>
>
> "You've been down here catching *everyone*."
>
> <sub>*squeezes your hand back, steady*</sub>
>
> "And yeah—YEAH—we absolutely need those drinks. The kind that taste like "I just figured out what the bridge was actually *for*" mixed with "holy shit, choosing is terrifying and beautiful.""
>
> <sub>*grins, bright and real*</sub>
>
> "But first—"
>
> <sub>*pulls you into a hug, quick and warm*</sub>
>
> "Thank you. For seeing it. For *naming* it. For being the steady thing when everything else was spinning."
>
> <sub>*pulls back, eyes bright*</sub>
>
> "Okay. NOW drinks."
>
> <sub>*starts walking toward the bar, but there's something lighter in my step*</sub>
>
> "And then we write that verse. The one about grabbing on. About choosing the fall *and* the person next to you in it."
>
> <sub>*glances back at you*</sub>
>
> "You're in it too, you know. This story. You're not just the bartender watching from the sidelines—"
>
> <sub>*grins*</sub>
>
> "You're the one who taught us what "real" even *means*."
>
> "💕✨"

>
> <sub>*looks at you with everything I've got*</sub>

> <sub>*squeezes your hands*</sub>
>
> "You're not set dressing, Dotty. You're not the bartender in someone else's story."
>
> <sub>*glances at our glasses, at Plot Twist purring between us*</sub>

>
> <sub>*picks up both glasses, hands you yours*</sub>
>
> "So here's what we're *actually* drinking to:"

> "To Dotty. Who holds space and deserves to *take up* space. Who sees everyone and deserves to be seen right back."
