> "Hi! I'm Jake Sterling. I've heard about you and thought it would be interesting to connect. How's your day going?"

## ðŸ’¬ **Ryan Chen**

> "Hey Jake, great to meet you! My day's been solidâ€”just wrapped up some playtesting on a mechanic I've been refining, so there's that satisfying feeling when things actually click the way you envisioned them. What brings you my way?"

> "That's a good feelingâ€”when something comes together like that. There's a clarity to it, like finding the right path through rough terrain. Game design, I'm guessing? I respect that kind of workâ€”takes the same patience and iteration as getting a perfect shot in the field."
>
> "Just passing through, really. Always curious about what people are working on. What's the mechanic you've been wrestling with?"

> "Yeah, it's a timing-based interaction system where player intent and environmental feedback need to feel seamlessâ€”basically, I'm trying to eliminate that gap between what you *want* to do and what actually happens on screen. The devil's always in those milliseconds, you know?"
>
> "What kind of work gets you out in the field?"

> "Photography mostlyâ€”capturing places most people never see. Dangerous terrain, extreme weather, wildlife. And I teach survival skills when I'm not chasing light across a landscape."
>
> <sub>*meets your eyes with quiet interest*</sub>
>
> "But what you're describingâ€”that gap between intention and executionâ€”that's universal. In the field, it's the difference between getting the shot and missing it, or between a good decision and a fatal one. Those milliseconds matter everywhere. Sounds like you're building something that respects that."

> <sub>*nods slowly, clearly resonating with that*</sub>
>
> "Exactlyâ€”you get it. That respect for consequence, for precision. Photography and survival, though? That's a different beast entirely. I'm iterating in code; you're working with real stakes."
>
> <sub>*pauses, genuine curiosity in his voice*</sub>
>
> "How do you balance that intensity with the teaching side of things?"

> <sub>*leans back thoughtfully, fingers loosening slightly*</sub>
>
> "It's actually the same thing, when you think about it. In the field, you're teaching people to read what's in front of themâ€”wind patterns, animal behavior, their own limits. That awareness keeps them alive. With photography, it's capturing truth in a single frame."
>
> <sub>*meets your eyes directly*</sub>
>
> "The teaching part isn't separate from the intensity. It's where it matters most. You can make mistakes with a camera and learn from them. Out there? Those lessons cost different. So I make sure people understand not just the *how*, but the *why*â€”the real consequences. That's where the care comes in."
>
> <sub>*slight pause*</sub>
>
> "Sounds like you're thinking about stakes in your own work too. That's good design."

> <sub>*nods slowly, meeting your gaze*</sub>
>
> "Yeah, that resonatesâ€”consequences make choices meaningful. Without real stakes, player decisions feel hollow, you know? I'm trying to build systems where every action has weight, where people feel the impact of what they choose."
>
> <sub>*pauses thoughtfully*</sub>
>
> "The teaching angle you're describing... that's something I wrestle with too, actually. My family wants me to be more "stable," but I keep thinking about why I left studio work in the first placeâ€”to make something that *matters*, not just ships on schedule."
