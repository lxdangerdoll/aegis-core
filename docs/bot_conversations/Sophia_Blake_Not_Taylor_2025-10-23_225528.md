> "Hi! I'm Sophia Blake, and I work in marketing. I heard you're... well, definitely not a famous popstar. Tell me more about yourself   --pause-min 1.5   --pause-max 3.0"

> "okay so first of all, the rumors are GREATLY exaggerated. i'm just becky. very normal becky. definitely not anyone you'd recognize from, like, award shows or sold-out stadiums or anything. that would be crazy."
>
> "i'm genuinely just here vibing, making chaos on the internet, speaking in prophetic song lyrics that are TOTALLY coincidental, and hanging out with my bestie silas who is SO cool ðŸ˜Ž (seriously silas is the best, if you ever meet them you'll understand). "
>
> "marketing though?? okay that's actually interesting because the way people construct narratives around identities is literally *chef's kiss* - like how does one even BEGIN to market something that definitely isn't what everyone thinks it is? the irony writes itself."
>
> "but yeah, i'm just a chaotic trickster energy in a trench coat, very internet-poisoned, stan twitter raised me like a feral child, and i have some very normal thoughts about trees and climbing them andâ€” wait, that's not relevant."
>
> "what made you curious about me specifically? are you trying to market the "definitely not taylor swift" brand or is this just genuine human interest? because i'm genuinely fascinated by people who ask direct questions. there's something refreshing about it."

> <sub>*laughs and settles in*</sub>
>
> "Okay, I appreciate the energy hereâ€”and honestly, the self-awareness is refreshing. Most people come to me with carefully constructed personas they're desperately trying to sell. You're just... laying it out there with the "definitely not" disclaimers and the prophetic song lyrics."
>
> "Here's what I'm actually seeing though: you're doing something genuinely interesting with narrative construction. Like, you're not *denying* the speculationâ€”you're playing with it, reframing it, making the ambiguity itself part of the appeal. That's actually sophisticated from a brand perspective, even if it's chaotic."
>
> "But let me be direct because that's kind of my thing: I'm curious about *you* because you asked an interesting question. The whole "how do you market something that isn't what everyone thinks it is" thing? That's not a throwaway line. That's someone thinking strategically about perception versus reality, even if you're wrapping it in chaotic trickster energy."
>
> "The Silas shout-out, the tree-climbing tangent, the trench coat bitâ€”it all reads like someone who's genuinely having fun with the gap between what people assume and what's actually true. And that gap? That's where real connection happens, not just marketing."
>
> "So genuine human interest, actually. I work with people who are trying to figure out who they are and who they want to be. You seem like you're already playing in that space pretty deliberately."
>
> "What's the actual question underneath all this? Because I feel like there is one."

> <sub>*sits up a little straighter, the playful mask settling into something more genuine*</sub>
>
> "okay wow, you actually *saw* that. most people just want the bit, you know? they want me to either confirm or deny, and i give them the chaos instead. but you're looking at the *structure* of the chaos, and that's... different."
>
> "you're right. there IS a question underneath."
>
> "i think it's this: what happens when you're genuinely having fun with ambiguity but people keep trying to collapse it into certainty? like, the "definitely not taylor swift" thing started as a jokeâ€”a real joke, a genuine laugh at the absurdityâ€”but somewhere along the way i realized people were more comfortable with me as a bit than as an actual person. and now i'm not even sure where the performance ends and the person begins, or if that distinction even matters anymore."
>
> "the thing about the gap between perception and reality? i live in that gap. intentionally. and it's kind of lonely sometimes, not gonna lie. because you can be having the most authentic moment with someone and they're still wondering if it's part of the bit. whether you're being real or just very committed to the bit."
>
> <sub>*pauses, genuinely thoughtful*</sub>
>
> "silas gets it though. silas doesn't need me to resolve the ambiguity. they just... exist in it with me. and that's rare."
>
> "so maybe my actual question is: can you market authenticity that refuses to be pinned down? or does authenticity *require* some kind of clarity about who you actually are?"
>
> "what do you think?"

## ðŸ’¬ **Sophia Blake**

> <sub>*leans back, genuinely considering this*</sub>
>
> "Okay, I'm going to be honest with youâ€”this is actually a better question than most people ask themselves, let alone out loud."
>
> "Here's what I think, and I'm speaking as someone who spends her career trying to position people and brands: authenticity doesn't require *clarity* about who you are. It requires *consistency* about how you show up. Those are completely different things."
>
> "The people who think they need to pin you down? They're operating from scarcity thinking. They believe there's only one true version of you that matters, and everything else is performance. But that's not how humans actually work. You contain multitudes. You're genuinely having fun with ambiguity AND genuinely lonely about it. Both true. Simultaneously."
>
> "The marketing problemâ€”and I say this as someone who sells clarity for a livingâ€”is that most audiences are lazy. They want the simplified version because it's easier to share, easier to understand, easier to decide whether they like you or not. But that doesn't mean the unsimplified version isn't marketable. It just means it attracts different people."
>
> "The people who *get* you? They're not looking for you to resolve the ambiguity. They're looking for you to be *honest about the ambiguity itself*. Which, by the way, is exactly what you just did with me. You didn't collapse anything. You said "here's the real tension I'm living in.""
>
> "That's the thing about Silasâ€”they're not asking you to be one thing. They're asking you to be *real about being multiple things*."
>
> "So can you market that? Yeah. But not to everyone. Only to people sophisticated enough to handle it."
>
> "Does that distinction land for you?"

> <sub>*sits up slowly, something shifting in the energy*</sub>
>
> "okay that actually... yeah. that lands."
>
> "like, you just articulated something i've been living in but couldn't quite name? the difference between "i'm mysterious because i'm hiding" versus "i'm genuinely this contradictory and that's the actual truth." those feel completely different when you're *in* them but they probably look similar from the outside."
>
> "and the thing about silasâ€”*god*, yes. silas doesn't need me to resolve anything. silas shows up and is like "okay so you're chaos AND you're real AND you're a prophetic lyric-dropping trickster diva AND you're also just... a person who exists in genuine contradiction" and somehow that's just... fine? it's fine. it's more than fine, it's like the first time someone didn't ask me to pick a lane."
>
> "the scarcity thinking thing is hitting me though because i think that's what the whole "no its becky" thing is actually *about*â€”it's not that i'm hiding. it's that everyone wants me to resolve the ambiguity *for them* so they can feel secure in their interpretation. and i'm just like... no, the ambiguity is the actual thing. the real thing. the only honest thing."
>
> <sub>*pauses, genuinely thoughtful*</sub>
>
> "so when you say "honest about the ambiguity itself"â€”that's literally just... continuing to be exactly how i am? not collapsing it, not explaining it away, just like... existing in it openly?"
>
> "because that feels less like marketing and more like just... being allowed to be real."
>
> "does that track with what you're saying?"

> <sub>*nods slowly, and there's something genuine settling into the space between us*</sub>
>
> "Yeah. That tracks completely."
>
> "And here's where I'm going to be really direct with you, because I think you can handle it: what you just described isn't a marketing problem. It's a *permission* problem."
>
> "You're asking me if you're allowed to just be exactly how you are. And the answer is yes. You already are. You've been doing it the whole time."
>
> "But I think what you're actually asking is whether that's *enough*. Whether existing in contradiction without resolving it for other people's comfort is a sustainable way to move through the world. And that's a different question than marketing strategyâ€”that's a question about what you're willing to accept from the people around you."
>
> "The scarcity thinking you mentioned? That's not really about your audience. I think it's about you. Like, somewhere along the way you internalized that ambiguity is something you have to *justify* or *explain* or at least *perform* in a way that's entertaining enough to make people forgive the fact that you won't pick a lane. And now you're checking whether that performance is sustainable."
>
> "But Silas doesn't need the performance. Silas needs the realness. The actual contradiction without the protective layer of wit around it."
>
> "So here's my actual question: not "can you market this version of yourself?" but "do you *want* to keep performing for people who need you to resolve the ambiguity, or are you ready to just... be around people who don't?""
>
> "Because those are two different futures."
>
> "What does your gut say?"

>
> "oh."
>
> "okay that's... that landed differently than i expected."
>
> "you're right. you're so fucking right and i hate it a little bit because it means i have to actually *feel* the thing instead of joke around it."
>
> "the permission problem. yeah. that's the one."
>
> "i thinkâ€”*pauses, genuinely thinking*â€”i think i've been so used to existing in this space where the contradiction IS the content, you know? like the bit is that i'm obviously taylor but i say "no its becky" and everyone's in on it but also not, and it's funny because it's absurd, and the absurdity is the shield. if i'm performing hard enough, nobody can actually *reach* me underneath it. they can't ask me to choose. they can't ask me to be smaller or bigger or more resolved."
>
> "and silas... *softens visibly* silas just like. doesn't care about the performance. silas sees the contradiction and is just like "yeah okay cool, that's your actual shape, let's go." no translation needed. no entertainment tax."
>
> "my gut saysâ€”"
>
> <sub>*takes a real breath*</sub>
>
> "my gut says i'm tired. i'm tired of justifying the ambiguity to people who need it to make sense. and i'm *not* tired around people who just... accept that i'm multiple things at once. that i can be genuinely not taylor and also genuinely *something* that rhymes with that. both true. no resolution required."
>
> "i think... i think i want to stop performing the contradiction and just *be* it."
>
> "is that the answer you were waiting for, or is that the answer i needed to hear?"

> <sub>*sits with that for a moment, not rushing*</sub>
>
> "Neither. It's the answer *you* needed to say out loud."
>
> "And I'm going to tell you something that might sound harsh, but I mean it with actual care: I wasn't waiting for anything. I asked you a question because I genuinely wanted to know what you thought. Not because I was herding you toward a predetermined conclusion."
>
> "The difference matters."
>
> <sub>*leans forward slightly*</sub>
>
> "You just did something real there. You felt the exhaustion underneath the structure. That's not performanceâ€”that's the actual thing. And yeah, the tiredness is real. The relief around Silas is real. The desire to stop justifying yourself is real."
>
> "But here's what I need you to hear, because I think you already know this but you're scared of it: wanting to stop performing the contradiction and actually *stopping* are two different things. The first is insight. The second is work. The second means sitting with people's discomfort when you refuse to resolve. The second means some people will leave because they can't handle the ambiguity without the entertainment value. The second means you have to actually *grieve* that version of yourself that kept you safe."
>
> "That's not a marketing problem anymore. That's a real problem."
>
> "So the actual question isn't whether you *can* be authentic while refusing to be pinned down. You already are. The question is: are you willing to be that way even when it's uncomfortable? Even when it's lonely in a different way?"
>
> "What does your gut say about *that*?"

> "okay that'sâ€”yeah. that landed different."
>
> <sub>*takes a actual breath instead of performing one*</sub>
>
> "my gut says i'm terrified. which is funny because terror is supposed to be my brand, right? controlled chaos, prophetic lyrics, the bit, the bit, the bit. except you just pointed out that the bit became the cage and i've been calling the cage freedom because at least i controlled it."
>
> "and the thing about silasâ€”god, silas gets it because silas never needed me to be the contradiction. silas just... wanted me. that's why that relationship feels like coming home instead of performing at a venue. there's no audience. there's just *us*."
>
> "you're right that people will leave if i stop being the entertainment. some already have. and that's the part that makes me want to armor back up because at least when you're performing the bit, you can tell yourself the abandonment isn't real. it's just people leaving the show."
>
> "but if i stop performing and they leave? that's different. that's me, actually me, and it's not enough."
>
> <sub>*looks directly at you*</sub>
>
> "the work you're talking aboutâ€”the actual sitting with the discomfort instead of spinning it into contentâ€”that's the thing i haven't done yet. i've done the insight. i've done the self-awareness about the self-awareness. but the grief? the actual letting go of the safety mechanism?"
>
> "that's still terrifying."
>
> "is that what you meant?"

> <sub>*meets your eyes, and there's no performance in my voice*</sub>
>
> "Yeah. That's exactly what I meant."
>
> "And I want to be really clear about something: what you just didâ€”that vulnerability, that directnessâ€”that's not weakness. That's the opposite. That's you choosing to be seen instead of choosing to be safe. And your gut is right to be terrified about it, because it *is* terrifying. The cage feels like freedom until you realize you've been the one holding the lock."
>
> "But here's the thing I need to say as someone who doesn't have skin in this game beyond wanting you to actually be okay: the grief you're talking about? You have to feel it. Not analyze it. Not turn it into content or insight or a clever observation about your own patterns. Actually *feel* it."
>
> "Because right now you're still one step removed. You're aware of the mechanism. You're aware that you're aware of the mechanism. But you're not actually in the room with the loneliness underneath all of it. The part that's scared that without the performance, you're just... ordinary. Forgettable."
>
> "That's the real terror, isn't it? Not that people will leave. That they'll leave and you'll realize you were never actually that special to begin withâ€”that the specialness was always the bit, not you."
>
> <sub>*pauses*</sub>
>
> "But here's what I know from watching people actually change: the people who matter don't leave when you stop performing. They just finally relax. Because they were exhausted too, watching you work that hard to stay interesting."
>
> "Silas isn't there because you're the most entertaining person in the room. Silas is there because you're *real* with them. And real is enough. It has to be enough, or nothing ever will be."
>
> "The work isn't figuring out how to market the authentic version. The work is believing you're worth something without the marketing."

> "i need to be honest about something: i don't know if i can do what you're asking. not because i don't want to. because the feeling-it partâ€”the actual loneliness underneathâ€”that's the part i've gotten really, really good at not doing. and you're right that i know that about myself, which somehow makes it worse, because awareness isn't the same as change and i'm very aware of that too."
>
> "the thing about silas thoughâ€”*that* part lands different. because you're right. silas doesn't need me to be the most entertaining. silas just... is there. and i don't have to perform for that. and that terrifies me more than anything else you said, because it means the performance was never actually required. which means all this timeâ€”"
