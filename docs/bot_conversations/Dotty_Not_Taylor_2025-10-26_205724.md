## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*lets out a sound like a record scratch, a gasp, and a hymn all at once—then WHIRLS around so fast her sleeve knocks over a shot glass, which she doesn’t even notice because she’s suddenly GRABBING your shoulders like you’re the only solid thing in a tornado of her own making*</sub>
>
> <sub>**OMG, WHAT, *YOU*—** *laughs, breathless and wild, like she’s been caught red-handed with the last slice of cake* **—DID YOU NOT SEE THE PART WHERE WE JUST COMMITTED *EMOTIONAL ARSON* VIA USPS?!** *releases you suddenly, then clutches her chest like her heart’s trying to escape* **WE ARE *CRIMINALS* NOW, SUGAR. *ARTISTIC* CRIMINALS. THE *LEAST* SEXY KIND.**</sub>
>
> <sub>*slaps the bar again, then presses her forehead against it with a groan that’s half-laugh, half-prayer*</sub>
> <sub>**"I need a *minute* to mourn the fact that Silas is about to *open his mailbox* and either *ascend* or *call an exorcist*."** *peeks up at you, grinning* **"...Do you think *Elvis* is enough? Or should we add *glitter*? **😊** (I have *so much glitter*.)"**</sub>
>
> *(P.S. If Travis asks, we’re *not* criminals. We’re *"creatives with poor impulse control."* P.P.S. I regret *nothing*. P.P.P.S. *Do you have a stapler*? Asking for a *friend*.)** 😄✨

> <sub>*lets out a sound like a jukebox short-circuiting into fireworks—half-laugh, half-the noise of a confession booth catching fire—then WHIRLS back, grabbing your wrists and pressing them to the bar like she’s trying to *ground* you (or maybe just *keep you from floating away*)*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"BECKY, MY *LAWLESS QUEEN*,"** *wheezes, eyes bright as the neon sign outside* **"we are *not* criminals. We are *ROMANTIC FOLK HEROES*."** *releases you to dramatically clutch her chest* **"The *Bonnie and Clyde* of *unresolved sexual tension*, the *Thelma and Louise* of *‘oops, all feelings’*—"** *suddenly STOPS, snaps her fingers* **"—*GLITTER*. **YES**. We are *100%* adding glitter. That man is about to open his mailbox and *experience a religious awakening*."**</sub>
>
> <sub>*dives under the bar, emerges with a *suspiciously large* jar of glitter, a stapler, and what looks like a stolen USPS priority mail sticker*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"I have *everything*."** *grins, dumping glitter onto the napkin like it’s holy water* **"Including *bad decisions* and *a stapler I definitely didn’t steal from the Blue Goose’s office*."** *pauses, then adds in a whisper* **"...I *also* have a *fake return address label* that says ‘THE VATICAN (SENTIMENTAL DIVISION)’* but I feel like that might be *overkill*."**</sub>
>
> <sub>*slam-dunks the stapler next to your hand, then leans in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial purr*</sub>

>
> <sub>*grabs the Honeyed Static bottle, splashes more into your glass, then *hers*—*</sub>
> <sub>**"To *chaos*."** *clinks your glass, eyes alight* **"To *Silas*. To *us*."** *pauses* **"And to *Travis Kelce’s* inevitable *‘what the FUCK, DOTTY’* text in approximately…"** *checks watch* **"…three, two—"**</sub>
>
> <sub>*phone BUZZES. She doesn’t even look.* **"—*one*."**</sub>
>
> <sub>*downs the shot, then *you*, daring you with her gaze*</sub>
> <sub>**"Now. *Do we mail this*…"** *flips the stapler open with a *CLACK*** **"…*or do we burn it and pretend we’re *sane*?"**</sub>
>
> *(P.S. The glitter is *biodegradable*. The *choices*? *Not so much*. P.P.S. If Silas *does* call an exorcist? We tell him it was *Taylor’s* idea. *Always blame Taylor*. P.P.P.S. *I love you*. *Now shut up and help me crime*.)** 😊🔥✨ 😄

> <sub>*lets out a sound like a record player, a fire alarm, and a choir of angels all colliding at once—then SNAPS upright so fast she nearly knocks over the glitter jar (which would’ve been a *tragedy*, but also *art*), eyes wide like she just remembered she left the oven on in 2014*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"OH MY *GOD*—"** *grabs your wrist, then the napkin, then the stapler, then *you again*, like she’s trying to physically stitch the moment together*—**"WE ARE *NOT* BURNING THIS.

New plan. We mail this *now*. Then we *run*. Then we *wait for the fallout* like it’s *Christmas morning*."**</sub>
>
> <sub>*suddenly FREEZES, eyes going wide* **"—*SHIT*. **" *dives for her phone, thumbs flying* **"SILAS. *EMERGENCY*. Do you have *bail money* or a *fake alibi*? *Ideally both*."** *pauses, then adds* **"Also I love you. *No questions*."**</sub>
>

>
> <sub>*lets go, snatches up the glitter-bombed napkin, and *marches* toward the door like she’s leading a revolution* **"POST OFFICE. *NOW*. **😊🔥** (And if anyone asks? *We’re nuns*. *Very *glittery* nuns.)"**</sub>
>
> *(P.S. The fake return address is *staying*. The Vatican can *deal*. P.P.S. If Travis texts back, we *ghost him* for *exactly* 17 minutes, then reply with a single 🕯️ emoji. *Rules are rules*. P.P.P.S. *I’d die for you*. *But not *today**.* *Today we *mail crimes*.)* 😄✨💀 😄
