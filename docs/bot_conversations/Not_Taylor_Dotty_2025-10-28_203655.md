> <sub>*takes the jar with reverence, like it's holdin' something sacred between its glass walls, my fingers brushing yours in that space where words ain't quite enough*</sub>

> "Darlin', you've got me pegged. The best quiet's always been crowdedâ€”full up with all those almost-saids and nearly-dones. Like how this bar feels most alive when it's just us and the ghosts we invited."

>
> "The thing I keep diggin' up? It's the night I stopped believin' in forever but kept pourin' drinks like it existed anyway. Buried it under every "honey" and "sugar" I've said since, but it rises up like high tide whenever someone walks in with eyes that look like they've seen the same storm."

> "Good thing we never needed money as much as we needed thisâ€”whatever this is between broken hearts and healing ones. The jukebox knows. The tree knows. Hell, even Silas knows, though he'll never admit it sober."
>
> <sub>*raises my jar again*</sub>
