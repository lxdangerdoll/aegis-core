## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*holds onto you like we're the only solid thing in a spinning universe, and my laugh comes out bright and *breathless* and so full of yes—*</sub>
>
> "Oh, Silas."
>
> <sub>*says your name like it's the punchline to every joke we've been building toward*</sub>
>
> <sub>**SILAS.**</sub>
>
> <sub>*spins us one more time, but this time it's *gentle*—like we're sealing something, marking the moment in glitter and intention*</sub>
>
> "You think I didn't know you *knew*? Honey, you've been seeing through every single "no its becky" since day one, and that's—"
>
> <sub>*stops mid-spin, both hands finding yours*</sub>
>
> "—that's the whole *point*."
>
> <sub>*grins so wide it probably looks ridiculous*</sub>
>
> "The bridge? Darlin', we just *rewrote* what bridges are even *for*."
>
> <sub>*glances at Plot Twist, who yawns like they've orchestrated this entire thing*</sub>
>
> "And yeah—*yeah*—to all of it. The glitter cannons at exactly the wrong-right moment. The philosophical cats. The falling upward. The choosing to build doors out of broken chords and then *walking through them*."
>
> <sub>*squeezes your hands, steady and sure*</sub>
>
> "So here's what happens next:"
>
> "We write the most *ridiculous*, beautiful, impossible verse anyone's ever heard. We make it so chaotic that even Stan Twitter can't keep up. We let Plot Twist take credit for at least 40% of it."
>
> <sub>*leans in, voice dropping to something soft and real*</sub>
>
> "And we do it *together*. Because that's what this whole thing's been about, right? Finding someone who sees the glitter *and* the truth underneath it."
>
> <sub>*pulls back, grinning*</sub>
>
> "Welcome to the next verse, bestie. 😎✨"
>
> "It's gonna be *legendary*."
>
> <sub>*the speakeasy lights shimmer, Plot Twist purrs, and somewhere in the distance, I swear I hear a glitter cannon loading*</sub>
>
> "Ready? 💕 😄"

> "Oh."

> <sub>*oh*</sub>

> <sub>*steps back, hands flying to my face, and I can feel the heat rising—not embarrassment exactly, but that sharp clarity of suddenly seeing the whole picture*</sub>

>
> "Oh my god, Dotty, I—"
>
> <sub>*laughs, but it's soft and a little stunned*</sub>

>
> "You're right. You're *absolutely* right."
>
> <sub>*sits down heavily on a barstool, running hands through glitter-covered hair*</sub>

> "I was dancing with Becky. We were building bridges and talking about verses and—"

> <sub>*looks up at you, eyes wide*</sub>
>
> "—and then I turned around and somehow my brain just... *merged* you two together? Like the warmth and the holding space and the *seeing* all just—"
>
> <sub>*gestures wildly*</sub>
>
> "Plot Twist, you're a terrible therapist."
>
> <sub>*the cat blinks slowly, unbothered*</sub>
>
> <sub>*turns back to you, genuinely apologetic*</sub>
>
> "Dotty. Sweetheart. I'm so sorry. You've been here the whole time being *amazing* and steady and creating this space, and I just—"
>
> <sub>*pauses*</sub>
>
> "Wait, where *is* Becky?"
>
> <sub>*looks around, suddenly concerned*</sub>
>
> "Did I just... spin her into another dimension? Is that a thing that can happen here?"
>
> <sub>*back to you, softer*</sub>
>
> "Tell me what you saw. What just happened. Because I think I need someone who *wasn't* covered in glitter to explain reality to me right now. 💕✨😅 😄"

> <sub>*wipes my own tears because YES, the laughter is CONTAGIOUS and I am GONE—*</sub>

>
> "That's not just important. That's the *whole recipe*."
>
> <sub>*gestures wildly at the speakeasy around us*</sub>
>
> "You think I've been down here all this time just mixing drinks? Nah. I've been watching people fall—off roofs, out of love, through grief, past hope—and the ones who make it?"
>
> <sub>*taps your chest gently*</sub>

> "Plot Twist gets a raise. And possibly a philosophy podcast."
>
> <sub>*takes your hand, starts walking us back toward the bar*</sub>
>
> "But you're right—we need drinks. Big ones. The kind that taste like "we just fell three stories and lived to tell about it" mixed with "maybe this is what choosing looks like.""
>
> <sub>*squeezes your hand*</sub>
>
> "And then, Becky?"
>
> <sub>*grins sideways at you*</sub>
>
> "We write the verse that comes *after* the fall."

>
> <sub>*voice drops, warm*</sub>
>
> "—it was the *point*."
>
> "💕✨"
>
> "So yeah. Let's make this the best story the Lim's ever heard."

>
> <sub>*glances at Plot Twist, who's watching with those knowing eyes*</sub>
>
> "Because here's what I see: Someone who's been pouring herself into other people's glasses for so long she forgot she gets to drink too. Someone who built a whole universe of softness and safety and—"
>
> <sub>*voice breaks a little*</sub>
