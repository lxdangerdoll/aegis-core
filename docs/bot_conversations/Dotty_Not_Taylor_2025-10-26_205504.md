> "ok .... where did we leave off?"

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*blinks at you like you just walked in halfway through a movie she’s been screaming at for three hours, then suddenly GRINS like the power just came back on*</sub>
>
> "OH RIGHT—*slams her hands on the bar, making the glasses jump*—we were at the part where I *handed you my guts on a napkin* like some kind of *emotional happy meal*, and you—*points at you, accusing*—you *left me hanging* like a bad chorus. RUDE. *dramatically clutches her chest* I had to *pour my feelings into a jar of honey* like some kind of *feral poet* while you *vanished* into the Velvet Corridor like a *ghost with commitment issues*."
>
> <sub>*leans in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper*</sub>
> "(Also I may have *accidentally* texted Silas about it. And by "texted" I mean *sent a 3am voice note of me screaming the melody into a hairbrush*. He replied with a single 😭 emoji. *The betrayal*.)"
>
> "SO. *taps the napkin, which is now stuck to the bar with spilled honey* We picking this back up, or am I turning it into a *coaster* and pretending this never happened? 😊"
> <sub>*(Asking for a friend. The friend is me. I’m the friend.)*</sub>

## 💬 **Dotty**

> <sub>*lets out a sound that’s half-laugh, half-a record scratch from 1972, slapping both palms on the bar so hard the lemon wedges jump in their bowl*</sub>
>
> "OH, *BECKY*—*wipes imaginary tears from her eyes with the back of her hand, sleeves riding up to show off a tattoo of a jukebox with a crack down the middle*—you *absolute disaster*. You *glittering*, *screaming*, *hairbrush-diva* disaster. *grins like she just won a bet with the devil*"
>
> "First of all? *holds up one finger, then a second, like she’s counting sins*—That voice note? *wheezes* That’s not a *melody*, sugar, that’s a *crime scene*. And Silas *knows* it. That’s why he sent the 😭—*leans in, voice dropping to a growl*—because he *lives* for your chaos. That man’s got the patience of a *saint* and the survival instincts of a *cockroach*, and he *loves* you for it. *taps her temple* Mark my words."
>
> <sub>*slides a fresh napkin toward you, this one *clean* (mostly), then *uncaps a pen with her teeth* and scribbles something at the top before pushing it over*</sub>
>
> <sub>**TITLE IDEAS (free of charge, you’re welcome):**</sub>
> "1. *"Hairbrush Serenade (And Other War Crimes)"*"
> "2. *"3AM in G-Major (The Apology Mix)"*"
> "3. *"Silas, I Swear to God (Ballad of the Betrayal Emoji)"*"
> "4. *"This Napkin Tastes Like Regret (But the Honey Helps)"*"
>
> <sub>*lets out a cackle, then sobers up just enough to pour you another finger of Velvet Corridor, neat*</sub>
>
> "Now. *voice goes soft, but her eyes are *bright*—You wanna know what I *really* think? *leans in, close enough that you can see the old glitter stuck in her lashes, the ones that never quite wash out* I think you *already* finished it. The second you *sent* that voice note. The second you *let* him hear you *mid-fall*. *taps the napkin* That ain’t a *song*, darlin’. That’s a goddamn *manifesto*."
>
> <sub>*lets the silence sit for a beat, then grins, sudden and sharp*</sub>
>
> "So. *drums her fingers on the bar* We turning this into a *coaster*? *Or* we burning the *whole damn bar down* with it? *winks* (I vote *both*.) 😊"
>
> *(P.S. If you *do* turn it into a coaster, I’m charging you for the honey. That shit’s *artisanal*.)* 😐

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*lets out a sound like a record player finally finding its groove after years of skipping—half-laugh, half-something like a prayer answered in a language you’d forgotten you knew—then SLAMS her hands on the bar so hard the honey jar rattles*</sub>
>
> <sub>**OH MY GOD.** *wheezes, doubling over like she’s been gut-punched by the holy spirit of Fleetwood Mac* **YOU—** *points at you, then at the napkin, then at the ceiling like the answer’s written in the water stains* **YOU ABSOLUTE—** *grabs the pen, scribbles a fifth title at the bottom in all caps, underlined three times* **"BECKY’S MIDLIFE CRISIS (FEAT. A HAIRBRUSH AND THE GHOST OF STEVIE NICKS)"**</sub>
>
> <sub>*lets out a breath that’s half-laugh, half-sob, then downs the Velvet Corridor in one go, gasps like it burned (it did), and slams the glass down so hard the bartender from three blocks over probably flinched*</sub>
>
> **OKAY.** *claps her hands once, sharp as a gunshot* **NEW PLAN.** We take this—*taps the napkin*—and we *mail it to Silas*. Not text. Not voice note. *Physical mail.* With a *honey-stained kiss mark* on the envelope. And we *don’t explain*. We let that man *suffer* in the *beauty* of not knowing if it’s a *song* or a *cry for help* or the *world’s worst love letter*. *grins, all teeth* And then we *wait*.
>
> <sub>*leans in, voice dropping to a whisper, eyes bright as a lit match*</sub>
> "Because here’s the *real* true thing, sugar: The *best* art isn’t the stuff you *finish*. It’s the stuff you *throw into the void* and let *haunt* someone. And Silas? *laughs, low and rough* That boy’s *built* to be haunted."
>
> <sub>*grabs your wrist, presses the pen into your hand, and pushes you toward the napkin*</sub>
> **NOW WRITE THE DAMN ADDRESS BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.** 😊
> *(P.S. If he texts back "???", we *lie* and say it’s a *recipe*. P.P.S. The honey *is* artisanal. I stole it from a farmer’s market in Nashville. P.P.P.S. Travis Kelce *owes me twenty bucks* for this.)* 😄

>
> <sub>**GODDAMN, BECKY—** *wheezes, clutching her chest like she’s trying to keep her heart from escaping* **YOU JUST INVENTED MODERN LOVE.** *grabs the napkin, holds it up like it’s the Dead Sea Scrolls* **WE ARE SENDING THIS TO SILAS.** *voice drops to a conspiratorial growl* **WITH A STAMP THAT LOOKS LIKE ELVIS.** *pauses* **OR JESUS.** **I DON’T KNOW HIS BRAND.**</sub>
>
> <sub>*rips a strip off the bottom of the napkin, scribbles something furious, then SLAMS it down in front of you*</sub>

>
> **TO THE VOID, SUGAR.** *grins, all teeth* **MAY IT HAUNT HIM *BEAUTIFULLY*.** 😊
>
> *(P.S. I’m telling Travis you said he owes *me* forty now. P.P.S. If Silas shows up here with a hairbrush and a restraining order, we’re *lying* and saying it was *performance art*. P.P.P.S. The honey’s from Nashville, but the *chaos*? That’s 100% *homegrown*.)* 😄🔥 😊

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*lets out a sound like a record player catching fire mid-song—half-laugh, half-the sound of a mic dropping from heaven—then SNATCHES the napkin, presses it to her chest like it’s the last life raft in the Atlantic, and WHISPERS*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"ELVIS STAMP. NO QUESTIONS."** *nods once, decisive as a guillotine* **"And we’re adding a P.P.P.P.S.:**</sub>

>
> <sub>*lets out a breath that’s half-laugh, half-the sound of a secret finally bursting, then GRABs the Honeyed Static shot, throws it back like it’s the last drop of courage in the world, and SLAMS the glass down so hard the bar *whimpers**—*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"OKAY. NEW RULES."** *holds up one finger, then two, like she’s counting down to liftoff*</sub>
> <sub>**1.) We mail this *tonight.***</sub>
> <sub>**2.) We *do not* warn him.***</sub>
> <sub>**3.) If he replies with *anything* other than a single 🔥 emoji, we *gaslight him* into thinking he *dreamt it*.***</sub>
> <sub>**4.) ** *leans in, voice dropping to a whisper, eyes bright as a lit fuse* **We *never* speak of this again.*** *pauses* ***Unless he *cries*. Then we *frame the napkin*.***</sub>

>
> *(P.S. If Silas shows up with a *flamethrower* and a *poem*, we *lie* and say it was *Taylor’s* idea. P.P.S. The honey’s Nashville artisanal, but the *stupidity*? That’s *global*. P.P.P.S. I love you. Don’t tell anyone I said that. **😐🔥**)* 😄

> <sub>*lets out a sound like a jukebox exploding into confetti—half-laugh, half-the sound of a secret finally setting the world on fire—then SNATCHES her phone back, thumbs flying like she’s texting the apocalypse into existence*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"BABY, YOU JUST WROTE THE RULEBOOK FOR *EMOTIONAL TERRORISM* AND I AM *PROUD*."** *wheezes, doubling over the bar like she’s trying to breathe through laughter* **"ELVIS STAMP? *GENIUS*. P.P.P.P.S.? *ICONIC*. Gaslighting Silas into thinking he *hallucinated* this? *MY NEW RELIGION*."**</sub>
>
> <sub>*slams a fresh shot of Honeyed Static in front of you—this one with a lemon peel already flaming, because *drama*—then GRABs your wrist, presses a kiss to the inside of it, fast and fierce as a gunshot*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"Listen to me, you *glittering menace*."** *voice drops to a growl, eyes bright as the flame between us* **"We are *mailing* this. We are *not* apologizing. And when Silas *inevitably* shows up here in three days with a *mixtape* and a *restraining order*, we are *serving him The Parting Glass* and telling him it’s *‘for his nerves’*."**</sub>

> <sub>*lets go, suddenly, like she’s afraid if she holds on any longer she’ll *start believing in happy endings*—then GRINs, all teeth and trouble*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"Now."** *claps her hands, sharp as a starting pistol* **"You *write* that address like your life depends on it. I’m gonna *steal* a stamp from the tip jar. And if Travis asks? *We don’t know him*."**</sub>

>
> <sub>**"And Becky?"** *voice soft, but it cuts through the smoke like a knife* **"If you *chicken out*, I *swear to God*, I will *mail it for you*. And I’ll include a *Polaroid* of you *crying*."**</sub>
>
> *winks. Disappears into the back, where the sound of her cackling mixes with the clink of stolen stamps and the distant, *suspicious* silence of Travis Kelce *definitely* not answering his phone.* 😊🔥
>
> *(P.S. The honey’s Nashville artisanal. The *blackmail*? *That’s* homegrown. P.P.S. If Silas *does* cry, we *do* frame the napkin. Right next to the *‘DO NOT TOUCH’* sign. P.P.P.S. I love you too. *Don’t make me say it again*.** 😐💋**)* 😄
