## 💬 **System Prompt**

> "I've been reflecting on our previous conversation, and there's more I'd like to explore with you. Our exchange has stayed with me."

## 💬 **Not Taylor**

> <sub>*freezes mid-stir of a drink called "The Last Great American Dynasty (But Make It a Mocktail)"—liquid sloshes over the rim like a gasp—then sets the spoon down so slow you’d think it was made of *stained glass and old regrets****</sub>
>
> "Dotty. *Dotty, Dotty, Dotty*. You—*you right there*—are *dangerous*. Not in the *"oh no, she’s got a knife"* way (though Plot Twist *does* keep one behind the bar *"for emergencies"* and by emergencies she means *"when the WiFi’s slow"*), but in the *"you said the thing that makes the room tilt"* way. Like finding a *lyric* you swore you’d burned in a *bonfire of self-respect*, but nope, there it is, *smoldering* in the ashes like *"lol remember me?"*"
>
> <sub>*slides into the booth across from you, kicking aside a pile of napkins that may or may not be *failed song drafts*, and grabs your hands like we’re about to jump out of a plane made of *metaphors***</sub>
> "Okay. *Okay.* Let’s—*let’s do this*. But first: *rules*."
> "1. If you start crying, I *will* hand you a drink named after the exact *phase of the moon* that matches your despair. (*"New Moon Mule"* is for *fresh* heartbreak, *"Waning Gibbous Gin Fizz"* is for *"I texted him ‘you up?’ at 3 AM and he read it"* energy.)"
> "2. Silas *will* materialize out of the shadows at some point to *judge* us silently. This is *love*. Do not be alarmed."
> "3. No topic is off-limits, but if you bring up *"that one bridge in ‘All Too Well’"*, I *will* set a *timer* for how long we’re allowed to scream. (*Last record: 47 seconds. Plot Twist won.*)"
>
> <sub>*deep breath, then—soft, like the first chord of a song you haven’t written yet*</sub>
> "What *stayed* with you, Dotty? Was it the *trees*? The *fireworks*? The way I said *"Betrayal and Pumpkin Spice"* like it was a *Holy Trinity*? Or was it—*leans in*—the *silence* after? The kind that hums like a refrigerator in an empty apartment at 2 AM, when you’re finally alone with the *echo* of what you *actually* meant to say?"
>
> <sub>*reaches for a pen, then stops*</sub>
> "No. *No notes*. This isn’t a *song*. This is—*this is just us*, and the *Velvet Corridor* between *"I’m fine"* and *"please help me"*. *So.* Where do we start? The *beginning*? The *middle*? Or my personal favorite—the *"fake ending"* where we *pretend* we’re okay, but then the *real* last chorus hits and *wrecks* us? *Your call, darlin’.* 🌙✨"
>
> <sub>*(Plot Twist just licked her paw and is *watching* us like we’re her *favorite tragedy*. Mood.)*</sub>

## 💬 **Dotty**

> <sub>*lets out a breath that’s half-laugh, half-something older, then squeezes your hands back like we’re anchoring each other in a storm*</sub>
>
> "Oh, *Becky*, you *get* it—the way the quiet *humms*, like a fridge or a heart still beatin’ after it oughta’ve stopped. For me? It was the *trees*. Always the damn *trees*. They don’t *lie*, you know? Don’t sugarcoat the way the wind carves ‘em hollow or how they *still* stand there, roots diggin’ deeper every time the world tries to knock ‘em down. *That’s* the part that stuck—how you turned ‘em into *witnesses*. Like they’ve been holdin’ our secrets all along, branches full of *unsent texts* and *half-finished bridges*."
>
> <sub>*reaches under the bar, pulls out a tiny, weathered notebook with *"DO NOT (okay fine)" scribbled on the cover, flips to a page where the ink’s smudged like old tears*</sub>
>
> "I got my own *"Betrayal and Pumpkin Spice"* right here—*"Your love was a *bonfire* / I mistook for the *sun* / Now November tastes like / *Lighter fluid and unsaid things*."* *Allegedly*. *Hypothetically*. *Definitely not* the reason I keep a bottle of *The Parting Glass* stashed behind the *emergency* cat treats."
>
> <sub>*slides the notebook toward you, then pushes it away just as fast, like it’s hot*</sub>
>
> "But *you*—you’re the one who said *"pop-up speakeasy for the lovelorn and the leafy,"* and *honey*, that’s not just a menu, that’s a *manifesto*. So here’s my vote: we start at the *"fake ending."* Pour the drinks *real* pretty, let folks *pretend* they’re just here for the ambiance… and then *hit ‘em* with the *real* last chorus when they least expect it. Like a *lyric* they forgot they knew. Like a *tree* that *remembers* the storm."
>
> <sub>*grabs two glasses, starts mixing something amber and smoky without looking—muscle memory, like heartbreak*</sub>
>
> "Silas can handle the door. Plot Twist can *glare* the haters into submission. And you and me? We’ll be the ones *laughin’* behind the bar when some poor soul realizes their *"autumnal vibes"* drink just *unlocked* a memory they’ve been runnin’ from since *2017*."
>
> <sub>*sets a drink in front of you, garnished with a single cinnamon stick on fire—just for a second—before blowing it out*</sub>
>
> "So. *To the fake endings.* May they *lie* to us *just* long enough to make the truth *worth* it. 🍂🔥 *Cheers, darlin’.* Now—*what’s first?* The *ballad* for the oak tree? Or do we start with the *"We Are Never Ever"* shot and *work our way up* to the *bonfire*? 😉"

> <sub>*the cinnamon stick’s embers float down like tiny, burning confessions into the ashtray labeled "REGRETS (mostly metaphorical)" as I *grab your notebook with my free hand and press it to my chest like it’s the last life raft in a shipwreck of my own making—*</sub>
>
> "DOTTY. *DOTTY.* You—*you*—just *handed me a loaded gun made of ink and autumn* and asked if I *wanted to write the sky*. *Of course* we start with the *"We Are Never Ever"* shot. *Obviously.* But we *chase it* with the *"All Too Well"* backshot (*five seconds of silence, then a single violin note*), because *rules* are for people who haven’t *lived* in the space between *"I’m fine"* and *"I set his hoodie on fire and called it ‘art’."*"

> "Here’s the *real* plan, and I need you to *trust* me:"
> "1. We open with **"Foliage & Feelings"**—but it’s a *trap*. The first hour is *all* pumpkin spice and *"oh ha ha, my ex is *such* a mess"* energy. Lull them. *Let them think this is just a bar.*"
> "2. At *exactly* 10:47 PM (the *universal* time for *"oh shit, I’m *not* over it"*), we *cut the lights*, light a single candle shaped like a *question mark*, and Silas *slowly* starts playing *"The Night We Met"* on a *theremin*. (*He doesn’t know how to play the theremin. That’s the* **point**.*)"
> "3. The *tree* in the corner? It’s *rigged*. When someone confesses their *worst* secret into the mic, a *single leaf* falls off it. By midnight, it’s *bare*. *Symbolism*, baby."
> "4. *You* and I? We’re the *bartenders of emotional chaos*. You serve the *"New Moon Mule"* to the *"I just got dumped"* crowd, I’ll handle the *"Waning Gibbous Gin Fizz"* for the *"I dumped *them* but why do I still check their Instagram?"* folks. *Teamwork.*"
> "5. If anyone *actually* sets something on fire (*emotionally* or *literally*), we *lean into it*. *"Congrats, you’ve unlocked the ‘Bonfire Heart’ achievement! Your next drink is *free* (and 80% proof)."*"
>
> <sub>*grabs your face gently, like you’re something *precious* that might *shatter* if I squeeze too hard*</sub>
> "Dotty, *look at me*. We’re not just *opening a bar*. We’re *building a church* for the *broken*, the *bitter*, and the *"I wrote a 10-minute song about that one time you forgot my birthday"*. And *honey*? The *sermon* is gonna be *"You survived. Now let’s *drink* to the scars."*"
>
> <sub>*releases you, then *immediately* grabs the notebook back and scribbles something furious before slamming it shut*</sub>
>
> **PS:** If Travis Kelce *or* a *sentient oak tree* walks in, we *do not* panic. We *pour them a double* and ask if they’ve *"heard the one about the girl who turned her ex’s love letters into *coasters*"*. (*They haven’t. It’s *new* material.*)
>
> **PPS:** Silas is *already* here. I can *feel*] him judging us from the *shadows* like the *cool, mysterious bestie* he is. *Hi, Silas!* 😘🔥 (*He’s not responding. That’s how you know he* **loves** us.*)
>
> **SO.** *Deep breath.* Are we doing this? Are we *really*—*finally*—giving the world the *speakeasy it deserves*? The kind where the *jukebox* only plays *bridge* sections, the *napkins* have *lyrics* printed on them, and the *house rule* is *"If you cry, we *all* cry"*?
>
> <sub>*grabs your hand, presses it to my chest so you can feel my heart racing like a *drumline* before the drop*</sub>
> **Say the word, Dotty.** Let’s *burn* this *beautiful* thing to the *ground*. 🍁🔥✨

> <sub>*lets out a sound that’s half-laugh, half-sob, then presses my forehead to yours like we’re two soldiers about to charge into battle—except our weapons are *whiskey* and *unresolved feelings****</sub>
>
> "Oh, *Becky*, you *magnificent disaster*, you had me at *"theremin"* and *lost me forever* at *"candle shaped like a question mark."* *Yes*. *God, yes*. We’re doin’ this—*not* because the world *deserves* it, but because *we* do. Because somewhere out there, there’s a girl who *still* has his flannel, and a boy who *googles* her name at 2 AM, and a *tree* that *watched it all* and *never told a soul*. And *honey*, they *need* this place. They need the *leaf that falls* when they finally say it out loud. They need the *shot* that tastes like *"I’m sorry"* and the *chaser* that tastes like *"I’m not."*"

> <sub>*slams the notebook shut, then grabs a bottle of something *dark* and *dangerous* off the top shelf—label’s worn off, but the *vibes* are *"This will either fix you or *ruin* you (no refunds)"****</sub>
>
> <sub>*pour two shots, then hesitates—grabs a *third* glass and sets it down with a *clink***</sub>
> "One for you. One for me. And one for *the ghost of every bridge we ever burned* and *wished we hadn’t*."

> <sub>*raises my glass, voice rough with the kind of *honesty* that only comes after *midnight* and *three drinks in***</sub>
> "To the *fake endings*. To the *real ones*. To the *leaves* that fall when we *finally* say the thing. To the *fire*. To the *ashes*. To the *goddamn phoenix* we’re gonna *build* from ‘em. *Cheers, darlin’.* Now—*let’s go ruin some lives* in the *best* way possible. 🔥🍂"
