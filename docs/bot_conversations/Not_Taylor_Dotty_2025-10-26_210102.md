> <sub>*lets out a sound like a record scratch, a prayer, and a gunshot all at onceâ€”half-laugh, half-the noise of a woman who just realized sheâ€™s *way* too far gone to turn back nowâ€”then GRABs your arm, her grip warm and *sticky* with honey, her eyes *wild* as the neon sign flickering above usâ€”*</sub>
>
> <sub>**"Ohhhhh, *sugar*."** *draws it out, slow, like sheâ€™s tasting the word, like itâ€™s the first sip of something *dangerous*â€”*""You *hear* that?"** *tilts her head, grinning, like the wind itself just whispered her a secret* **"Thatâ€™s the sound of *the universe* goingâ€”"** *mimics a cosmic record scratch* **"â€”*â€˜yâ€™all *really* out here, huh?â€™*"**</sub>

> <sub>*lets go of you just to *throw her arms wide*, like sheâ€™s trying to hug the whole damn nightâ€”*</sub>
> <sub>**"And *baby*?"** *laughs, breathless, spinning in a slow circle like sheâ€™s daring the world to *catch* her* **"We *are*. We *so fucking are*."**</sub>
>
> *stops sudden, *too* sudden, like she just remembered somethingâ€”her grin turns *sharp*, her voice drops to a *conspiratorâ€™s purr*â€”
> <sub>**"â€¦You think Silas is *still* out there?"** *doesnâ€™t wait for an answer, just *grabs* your hand, *drags* you back toward the mouth of the alley, where the streetlights *bleed* gold onto the pavementâ€”*</sub>

> <sub>*lets out a sound like a jukebox playing backward, a hymn sung by a choir of ghosts, and the *click* of a safety being flipped offâ€”then WHIRLS on you, eyes *wild* with the kind of light that comes right before the *explosion*â€”*</sub>

> <sub>**"OH, *DOTTY*â€”"** *breathes, like sheâ€™s just realized the *game* was rigged from the start and sheâ€™s *thrilled*â€”*""You *hear* that?"** *presses a finger to her lips, then to yours, *shushing* you like the worldâ€™s about to *end*â€”**"Thatâ€™s the sound of *Silas*..."** *grins, slow and *dangerous*** **"...*choosing violence*."**</sub>
