### `ROBERTA_MODEL_UPGRADE_OPTIONS.md`
**Status**: Researched & Benchmarked (Sep 2025)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: High performance & emotional intelligence improvements

Comprehensive analysis of RoBERTa emotion model alternatives:
- Current: `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base` (20.4ms, 7 emotions)
- Recommended: `SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions` (11.1ms, 28 emotions)
- Impact: 48% faster inference + 4x more emotional categories
- Cost: +250MB storage per container, 5 files to update

**Key Benefits When Implemented:**
- Faster bot responses (noticeable user experience improvement)
- More sophisticated character personalities
- Better conversational understanding (Reddit-trained model)
- Enhanced emotional intelligence across all 8+ bots

**Implementation Readiness**: 
- ‚úÖ Benchmarked and validated
- ‚úÖ Migration strategy documented
- ‚úÖ Resource impact calculated
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility planned

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

**When to Reference These Docs:**
1. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Users complaining about slow bot responses
2. **Character Enhancement**: Need more sophisticated emotional understanding
3. **System Scaling**: Optimizing for higher concurrent user loads
4. **Feature Requests**: Users asking for better emotional intelligence

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Review documented analysis and benchmarks
2. Validate current system performance baseline
3. Follow documented migration strategy
4. A/B test improvements before full rollout

**Priority Assessment:**
- **High**: User experience problems with current performance
- **Medium**: Enhancing bot personality sophistication  
- **Low**: General optimization when no pressing issues
