## Lessons Learned

### Migration Infrastructure

**Payload Indexes are Critical**:
- Temporal queries require `timestamp_unix` index for `order_by` operations
- Migration scripts must auto-create indexes during collection initialization
- Missing indexes cause silent failures or zero results

**Session-Awareness Matters**:
- "First" queries have implicit session context (4-hour window)
- Without session-awareness, historical bleed returns wrong memories
- Variable naming errors can disable features silently

### Character Personality Balance

**Personality Vector Strength**:
- Strong personality dimension maintains character authenticity
- TOO strong can override explicit mode requests (analytical precision)
- Balance needed between character consistency and format compliance

**CDL Tuning is Character-Specific**:
- Photographer characters emphasize artistic expression
- Educator characters include natural analytical structure
- Technical characters need explicit precision triggers

### Testing Patterns

**Comprehensive Testing Reveals Patterns**:
- Single test success doesn't validate full capability
- Multiple mode tests expose personality balance issues
- Temporal testing critical for migration validation

**Lucky Success ≠ Correct Implementation**:
- Jake Test 5 passed due to timing, not session-awareness fix
- Always verify WHY tests pass, not just THAT they pass
- Variable name bugs can hide behind lucky circumstances
