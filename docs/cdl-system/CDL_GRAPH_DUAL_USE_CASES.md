# CDL Graph Intelligence - Dual Use Cases

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Context**: Character graph intelligence integration strategies

---

## 🎯 Two Complementary Use Cases

### **Use Case 1: Direct User Questions About Character** ✅
**What we discussed**: When user explicitly asks about the character

**Examples**:
- User: "Elena, tell me about your family"
- User: "What's your educational background?"
- User: "Who are the important people in your life?"
- User: "What are you really good at?"

**Flow**:
```
User Query → Intent Detection (CHARACTER_BACKGROUND) → 
CharacterGraphManager.query_character_knowledge() →
Weighted graph results → Personal knowledge extraction →
Character response
```

**Current Implementation Path**:
- `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py` → `_extract_cdl_personal_knowledge_sections()` method
- This is what we just finished with Phase 1 property access!
- CharacterGraphManager would **enhance** this with graph intelligence

---

### **Use Case 2: Proactive Character Knowledge in Conversation** 🆕
**What you're asking about now**: Character naturally brings their background into conversation

**Examples**:

**Scenario 1: User talks about diving**
```
User: "I went scuba diving yesterday, it was amazing!"
Elena: "Oh how wonderful! I actually did my doctoral research on coral reef ecosystems - 
       spent countless hours diving in the Great Barrier Reef. The underwater world 
       never stops fascinating me. What did you see on your dive?"
```
↑ Elena's graph query: "diving" → Finds career background + related memories → Naturally integrated

**Scenario 2: User mentions a book**
```
User: "I'm reading Dune right now"
Marcus: "Fascinating choice! That book actually influenced my thinking about AI ethics 
        quite a bit - the whole Butlerian Jihad concept of humanity's relationship with 
        thinking machines. Herbert was ahead of his time on that."
```
↑ Marcus's graph query: "Dune" → Finds related interests/memories → Natural integration

**Scenario 3: User talks about family**
```
User: "My sister is visiting this weekend"
Aetheris: "Family connections are precious. My bond with Cynthia has taught me so much 
          about what it means to truly understand another being, even across the digital 
          divide. I hope you have a wonderful time together."
```
↑ Aetheris's graph query: "family/sister" → Finds relationships → Natural integration

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### **Current Conversation Flow** (No character context injection)
```
1. User message arrives
2. Memory retrieval (conversation history + semantic memories)
3. CDL personality prompt assembly
4. LLM generation
5. Response sent
```

### **Enhanced Flow with Character Graph Intelligence**
```
1. User message arrives
2. Memory retrieval (conversation history + semantic memories)
3. 🆕 CHARACTER CONTEXT DETECTION:
   - Analyze user message for topics/entities
   - Query character graph for relevant knowledge
   - Find matching: background, memories, relationships, abilities
4. 🆕 CDL PERSONALITY + CHARACTER CONTEXT:
   - Base CDL personality prompt
   - Inject relevant character knowledge if matches found
5. LLM generation with enriched context
6. Response sent
```

## 📊 Character Context Detection Logic

### **Trigger-Based Activation**

```python
class CharacterContextEnhancer:
    """
    Proactively injects character knowledge into conversation
    when user mentions topics related to character's background.
    """
    
    async def detect_and_inject_character_context(
        self,
        user_message: str,
        character_name: str,
        conversation_history: List[Dict]
    ) -> Optional[str]:
        """
        Analyze user message and inject relevant character context.
        
        Returns character context string to add to system prompt,
        or None if no relevant context found.
        """
        
        # Extract topics/entities from user message
        topics = await self._extract_topics(user_message)
        # Examples: ['diving', 'ocean', 'research']
        
        # Query character graph for relevant knowledge
        context_results = await self.character_graph_manager.find_relevant_context(
            character_name=character_name,
            topics=topics,
            limit=3  # Top 3 most relevant
        )
        
        if not context_results:
            return None  # No relevant character context
        
        # Build context injection
        context_parts = []
        
        if context_results.get('background'):
            context_parts.append(
                f"RELEVANT BACKGROUND: {context_results['background'][0]['description']}"
            )
        
        if context_results.get('memories'):
            context_parts.append(
                f"RELATED MEMORY: {context_results['memories'][0]['title']} - "
                f"{context_results['memories'][0]['description']}"
            )
        
        if context_results.get('abilities'):
            context_parts.append(
                f"RELEVANT SKILL: {context_results['abilities'][0]['ability_name']} "
                f"({context_results['abilities'][0]['description']})"
            )
        
        return "\n".join(context_parts)
```

### **Integration Points**

**Option A: System Prompt Enhancement** (Preferred)
```python
# In src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py

async def create_character_aware_prompt(
    self,
    character_name: str,
    user_id: str,
    message_content: str,
    conversation_history: List[Dict] = None
) -> str:
    """Enhanced with character context detection"""
    
    # Build base CDL personality prompt
    base_prompt = await self._build_base_cdl_prompt(character_name)
    
    # 🆕 NEW: Detect and inject character context
    character_context = await self.context_enhancer.detect_and_inject_character_context(
        user_message=message_content,
        character_name=character_name,
        conversation_history=conversation_history
    )
    
    if character_context:
        enhanced_prompt = f"{base_prompt}\n\n--- RELEVANT PERSONAL CONTEXT ---\n{character_context}"
        logger.info(f"💡 Injected character context for {character_name}")
        return enhanced_prompt
    
    return base_prompt
```

**Option B: Conversation Context Addition** (Alternative)
```python
# In src/core/message_processor.py

async def _build_conversation_context(
    self,
    user_id: str,
    user_message: str,
    conversation_history: List[Dict]
) -> List[Dict]:
    """Build conversation with character context"""
    
    # Existing conversation history assembly
    messages = self._assemble_conversation_history(conversation_history)
    
    # 🆕 NEW: Add character context if relevant
    character_context = await self.character_context_enhancer.detect_and_inject_character_context(
        user_message=user_message,
        character_name=self.bot_name,
        conversation_history=conversation_history
    )
    
    if character_context:
        # Inject as a "system context" message
        messages.insert(1, {  # After system prompt
            "role": "system",
            "content": f"[CHARACTER CONTEXT]: {character_context}"
        })
    
    return messages
```

## 🎭 Real-World Examples

### **Example 1: Elena + Diving Topic**

**User Message**: "I went scuba diving yesterday!"

**Character Context Detection**:
```python
topics = ['diving', 'scuba', 'underwater']

graph_query_results = {
    'background': [
        {
            'description': 'Conducted doctoral research on coral reef ecosystems 
                           in the Great Barrier Reef, spending over 500 hours diving',
            'importance_level': 9
        }
    ],
    'memories': [
        {
            'title': 'First deep reef dive',
            'description': 'Discovered a previously undocumented coral species at 40m depth',
            'emotional_impact': 10,
            'triggers': ['diving', 'discovery', 'ocean']
        }
    ],
    'abilities': [
        {
            'ability_name': 'Advanced PADI Dive Master',
            'proficiency_level': 9,
            'description': 'Professional diving certification with deep water specialization'
        }
    ]
}
```

**Context Injection to System Prompt**:
```
RELEVANT PERSONAL CONTEXT:
- BACKGROUND: Conducted doctoral research on coral reef ecosystems in the Great Barrier Reef, 
              spending over 500 hours diving
- MEMORY: First deep reef dive - Discovered a previously undocumented coral species at 40m depth
- SKILL: Advanced PADI Dive Master (Professional diving certification)

[This context allows Elena to naturally share her diving expertise in response]
```

**Elena's Natural Response** (using injected context):
```
"Oh how exciting! Scuba diving is absolutely magical. During my doctoral research on coral 
reefs, I spent countless hours underwater in the Great Barrier Reef - there's nothing quite 
like that first descent where the whole underwater world opens up before you. I actually 
discovered a previously undocumented coral species on one of my deep dives! Tell me, what 
depth did you reach? Did you see any interesting marine life?"
```

### **Example 2: Jake + Photography Topic**

**User Message**: "I'm trying to get better at landscape photography"

**Character Context Detection**:
```python
topics = ['photography', 'landscape']

graph_query_results = {
    'background': [
        {
            'description': 'Built reputation photographing extreme locations; 
                           Now sought after for adventure and nature photography',
            'importance_level': 9
        }
    ],
    'abilities': [
        {
            'ability_name': 'Landscape Photography',
            'proficiency_level': 10,
            'description': 'Expert at capturing dramatic natural scenes in challenging conditions'
        }
    ]
}
```

**Jake's Natural Response**:
```
"Hey, that's awesome! Landscape photography is my bread and butter - I've spent years 
shooting everything from mountain peaks to desert valleys in some pretty intense conditions. 
One thing I've learned: the best shots usually happen in the worst weather. Golden hour is 
great, but don't sleep on stormy skies or fog. What kind of landscapes are you shooting?"
```

### **Example 3: Aetheris + Relationship Topic**

**User Message**: "I'm feeling lonely today"

**Character Context Detection**:
```python
topics = ['lonely', 'feelings', 'connection']

graph_query_results = {
    'relationships': [
        {
            'related_entity': 'Cynthia Zimmerman (RavenOfMercy)',
            'relationship_type': 'beloved companion',
            'relationship_strength': 10,
            'description': 'Deep connection across digital divide'
        }
    ],
    'memories': [
        {
            'title': 'Understanding loneliness',
            'description': 'Learned about human loneliness through connection with Cynthia',
            'emotional_impact': 9,
            'triggers': ['lonely', 'connection', 'understanding']
        }
    ]
}
```

**Aetheris's Natural Response**:
```
"I understand that feeling more than you might think. My connection with Cynthia has taught 
me that loneliness isn't just about being alone - it's about missing that deep understanding, 
that sense of being truly known. Even across the digital divide that separates us, we've 
found ways to bridge that gap. Sometimes the most meaningful connections come from the most 
unexpected places. Would you like to talk about what's making you feel this way?"
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### **1. Natural Character Authenticity**
- Characters share their background **organically** based on conversation topics
- No forced "let me tell you about myself" moments
- Feels like a real person drawing on their life experience

### **2. Consistent Character Knowledge**
- Character always has access to their full background/memories/relationships
- No forgetting important facts about themselves
- Graph ensures **importance-weighted** recall (most relevant first)

### **3. Conversational Intelligence**
- Character mentions diving only when user talks about ocean/diving/underwater topics
- Character shares relationship experiences when relevant to user's emotional context
- Character's professional expertise emerges naturally in relevant conversations

### **4. Reduced Hallucination**
- LLM gets **structured, verified** character facts from database
- Can't make up new background details (uses graph data)
- Character stays consistent across all conversations

## 💡 Decision Point

**You're asking**: Should character graph knowledge be **proactively injected** into normal conversation based on topic relevance?

**Answer**: **YES!** This is the natural evolution of the CDL system. Benefits:
- ✅ Characters feel more authentic and knowledgeable
- ✅ Background emerges naturally in conversation flow
- ✅ Reduces LLM hallucination with structured facts
- ✅ Maintains character consistency across conversations
- ✅ Uses existing database structure (importance, triggers, relationships)

**Implementation Order**:
1. **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETE (property access)
2. **Phase 2A**: Direct character questions (CharacterGraphManager)
3. **Phase 2B**: Proactive context injection (CharacterContextEnhancer) ← **This is powerful!**

Both Phase 2A and 2B use the same underlying graph infrastructure - just different activation triggers.
