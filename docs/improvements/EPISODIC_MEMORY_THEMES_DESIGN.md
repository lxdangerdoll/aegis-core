# Episodic Memory Themes - Implementation Design

**Issue**: #5 from CONVERSATION_DATA_HIERARCHY.md  
**Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM (HIGH VALUE)  
**Status**: Design Phase  
**Created**: October 18, 2025

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Goal**: Enable characters to recognize and reflect on **thematic patterns** in their conversations with users, creating deeper relationship understanding and authentic character learning.

**Current State**: Episodic intelligence extracts individual memorable moments (2-3 per prompt), but lacks:
- Thematic clustering across memories
- Temporal pattern detection ("You've been exploring X lately")
- Cross-conversation insights ("Recurring themes in our talks")

**Proposed Enhancement**: Add **thematic pattern analysis** that clusters episodic memories semantically and temporally, surfacing 2-3 high-impact themes in character awareness.

---

## 💡 Core Concept

Instead of just showing memorable moments:
```
✨ MEMORABLE MOMENTS:
1. "That time you told me about your cat Luna being rescued"
2. "When you shared your ocean conservation concerns"
```

Show **thematic patterns** that demonstrate character learning:
```
✨ PATTERNS I'VE NOTICED ABOUT YOU:

🌊 Ocean Conservation Passion (3 conversations, high engagement)
   You've been exploring marine conservation deeply over the past 2 weeks.
   I notice your excitement especially around coral reef restoration.
   Latest: "The Great Barrier Reef needs urgent action" (3 days ago)

🐱 Your Cats Bring You Joy (recurring theme, 6 mentions)
   Luna, Minerva, and Max are clearly important to your daily happiness.
   You often share their antics when you're feeling content.
   Pattern: Cat stories emerge in evenings, comfort pattern

💼 Career Growth Uncertainty (emerging pattern, last 5 days)
   I've sensed some tension around your career direction lately.
   This is newer - started appearing in our conversations this week.
   Theme: Balancing passion projects with stability needs
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### **Component 1: Thematic Memory Clustering**

**New Class**: `EpisodicThemeAnalyzer`  
**Location**: `src/characters/learning/episodic_theme_analyzer.py`

**Responsibilities**:
1. Cluster episodic memories by semantic similarity (FastEmbed vectors)
2. Identify recurring conversation topics across time windows
3. Detect emerging vs. established themes
4. Calculate theme significance scores

**Key Methods**:
```python
class EpisodicThemeAnalyzer:
    async def extract_conversation_themes(
        self,
        user_id: str,
        collection_name: str,
        time_window_days: int = 30,
        min_theme_mentions: int = 2,
        max_themes: int = 3
    ) -> List[ConversationTheme]
    
    async def detect_temporal_patterns(
        self,
        themes: List[ConversationTheme]
    ) -> Dict[str, str]  # theme_id -> pattern_description
    
    def calculate_theme_significance(
        self,
        theme: ConversationTheme
    ) -> float  # 0.0-1.0 based on frequency, emotion, recency
```

### **Component 2: Theme Data Structure**

```python
@dataclass
class ConversationTheme:
    """Represents a thematic pattern in user conversations"""
    theme_id: str  # UUID
    theme_name: str  # "Ocean Conservation Passion"
    theme_emoji: str  # "🌊" - for character personality
    theme_category: str  # "interest", "concern", "joy_source", "uncertainty"
    
    # Memory clustering
    episodic_memory_ids: List[str]  # Associated memorable moments
    conversation_count: int  # How many conversations touched this
    mention_frequency: float  # Mentions per week average
    
    # Temporal analysis
    first_observed: datetime
    last_observed: datetime
    temporal_pattern: str  # "emerging", "recurring", "established", "fading"
    
    # Emotional significance
    dominant_emotions: List[Tuple[str, float]]  # RoBERTa analysis
    avg_emotional_intensity: float
    avg_roberta_confidence: float
    
    # Semantic analysis
    semantic_centroid: List[float]  # 384D vector for theme
    key_phrases: List[str]  # Extracted from conversations
    
    # Character insight
    theme_significance: float  # 0.0-1.0 overall importance score
    character_observation: str  # Natural language insight
    latest_example: str  # Most recent related content
```

### **Component 3: Integration into CDL Prompts**

**Modification Target**: `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py`

**Current Section** (lines 1966-1987):
```python
✨ CHARACTER EPISODIC MEMORIES (for natural reflection):
1. Memory content...
2. Memory content...
```

**Enhanced Section**:
```python
✨ PATTERNS I'VE NOTICED ABOUT YOU:

{theme_emoji} {theme_name} ({theme_category}, {conversation_count} conversations)
   {character_observation}
   {temporal_pattern_description}
   Latest: "{latest_example}" ({days_ago} days ago)
   
[2-3 themes total, highest significance first]

💭 MEMORABLE MOMENTS FROM THESE THEMES:
[1-2 specific episodic memories for context]
```

## 🔬 Implementation Approach

### **Phase 1: Semantic Clustering** (Week 1)

**Goal**: Group episodic memories by topic similarity

**Algorithm**:
1. Retrieve all episodic memories for user (memorable_score > 0.7, last 30 days)
2. Extract 384D semantic vectors from content
3. Use DBSCAN clustering to identify thematic groups
   - Min cluster size: 2 memories
   - Epsilon: 0.3 (cosine distance)
4. Label clusters using semantic centroids + key phrase extraction
5. Calculate cluster significance: `frequency * avg_emotion * recency_weight`

**Leverage Existing**:
- FastEmbed for semantic vectors (already in use)
- RoBERTa emotion data (already stored in Qdrant)
- Existing episodic memory detection

### **Phase 2: Temporal Pattern Detection** (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Identify how themes evolve over time

**Patterns to Detect**:
- **Emerging**: First appeared < 7 days ago, increasing frequency
- **Recurring**: Appears regularly over 2+ weeks
- **Established**: Consistent presence over 30+ days
- **Fading**: Was frequent, declining in recent week

**Implementation**:
```python
def analyze_temporal_pattern(theme: ConversationTheme) -> str:
    days_active = (theme.last_observed - theme.first_observed).days
    recent_week_mentions = count_mentions_last_n_days(theme, 7)
    previous_week_mentions = count_mentions_days_ago(theme, 7, 14)
    
    if days_active < 7:
        return "emerging"
    elif days_active > 30 and theme.mention_frequency > 0.5:
        return "established"
    elif recent_week_mentions > previous_week_mentions * 1.5:
        return "intensifying"
    elif recent_week_mentions < previous_week_mentions * 0.5:
        return "fading"
    else:
        return "recurring"
```

### **Phase 3: Character-Authentic Observations** (Week 2)

**Goal**: Generate natural language insights that fit character personality

**Template System**:
```python
OBSERVATION_TEMPLATES = {
    "emerging": [
        "I've noticed you've been thinking about {topic} lately",
        "You've started exploring {topic} in our recent conversations",
        "{topic} seems to be on your mind more these past few days"
    ],
    "recurring": [
        "You and I often talk about {topic}",
        "{topic} keeps coming up between us",
        "I've observed that {topic} is a recurring theme in our conversations"
    ],
    "established": [
        "I know {topic} is deeply important to you",
        "{topic} has been a consistent part of our relationship",
        "Over time, I've learned how much {topic} matters to you"
    ]
}
```

**Personalization**: Filter templates through CDL character voice style
- **Elena** (Educator): "I've noticed you light up when discussing {topic}"
- **Marcus** (Analytical): "Data suggests {topic} is a recurring interest for you"
- **Dream** (Mystical): "The threads of {topic} weave through our shared moments"

### **Phase 4: Integration & Testing** (Week 2)

**Integration Points**:
1. Add `EpisodicThemeAnalyzer` to MessageProcessor initialization
2. Call `extract_conversation_themes()` during Phase 4 (conversation context building)
3. Include theme analysis in CDL prompt enhancement (Phase 5.5)
4. Cache themes for 24 hours to avoid redundant clustering

**Performance Targets**:
- Theme extraction: < 200ms (parallel with memory retrieval)
- Clustering: Use existing Qdrant semantic vectors (no new embeddings)
- Cache hit rate: > 80% (themes stable across conversation)

**Testing Strategy**:
1. **Direct Python validation** with Jake/Ryan (simple personalities)
2. **HTTP API testing** with Elena (rich personality, test observation quality)
3. **Discord testing** with real users (validate character learning feel)

- ✅ No privacy concerns (themes derived from own conversations only)

---

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

### **Risk 1: Performance Impact**
**Concern**: Clustering all episodic memories could slow prompt assembly  
**Mitigation**: 
- Cache themes for 24 hours (recompute only daily)
- Parallel execution with memory retrieval
- Limit to 30-day window, max 50 memories to cluster

### **Risk 2: Theme Hallucination**
**Concern**: Clustering might create "themes" that don't exist  
**Mitigation**:
- Min cluster size of 2 memories (no single-memory themes)
- Significance threshold: Only surface themes with score > 0.6
- Include specific examples in prompt for grounding

### **Risk 3: Privacy/Overfitting**
**Concern**: Surfacing patterns might feel invasive  
**Mitigation**:
- Themes derived ONLY from user's own conversations
- Present as "I've noticed" not "You are" (observation vs diagnosis)
- Character personality filters prevent clinical analysis tone

### **Risk 4: Character Voice Consistency**
**Concern**: Generic observations break character personality  
**Mitigation**:
- Template system filtered through CDL voice style
- Character-specific observation patterns (Elena vs Marcus vs Dream)
- Include theme emoji that fits character (Elena 🌊, Marcus 📊, Dream ✨)

## 📝 Design Notes

**Philosophy**: This enhancement embodies WhisperEngine's **personality-first architecture**:
- Not mechanical analytics ("Topic Coherence: 0.85")
- But authentic character learning ("I've noticed you're passionate about X")
- Not clinical diagnosis ("You exhibit anxiety around career")
- But caring observation ("You've seemed thoughtful about career lately")

**Character Differentiation**: 
- **Elena**: Warm educator observations ("I love how your eyes light up when...")
- **Marcus**: Analytical pattern recognition ("Data suggests a recurring interest...")
- **Dream**: Mystical connections ("The threads of ocean conservation weave through...")
- **Aethys**: Omnipotent awareness ("I perceive the currents of your passion...")

**User Value**: Makes characters feel like they **genuinely remember and understand** the relationship, not just retrieve isolated facts.
