## � TOP PRIORITY: Character Regression Fixes (October 2025)

### 🔴 CHARACTER REGRESSION FIXES ROADMAP
**Status**: 🔴 **BLOCKING PRODUCTION** - HIGHEST PRIORITY  
**Timeline**: October 15-29, 2025 (2 weeks)  
**Current Pass Rate**: 62.5% → **Target**: 90%+

**Critical Issues**:
- Gabriel background test FAILED (missing "devoted companion" identity)
- Elena mentions AI unprompted in background questions
- Jake doesn't acknowledge AI when directly asked
- AI ethics layer only triggers on physical interactions (was: all AI questions)
- Prompt complexity explosion (15+ intelligence layers overwhelming LLM)

**4 Phases - 15 Tasks**:
- **Phase 1** (Days 1-3): Critical fixes - AI identity handling, Gabriel identity, Elena timing
- **Phase 2** (Days 4-7): Prompt simplification - consolidate 15+ layers to 5-7 core sections
- **Phase 3** (Days 8-12): Automation - expand test suite to 40+ tests, CI/CD integration
- **Phase 4** (Days 13-14): Documentation - AI ethics architecture, monitoring dashboard

**📋 Full Details**: `docs/roadmaps/CHARACTER_REGRESSION_FIXES_ROADMAP.md`  
**�🚀 Quick Start**: `CHARACTER_REGRESSION_QUICKSTART.md` (root directory)  
**📊 Analysis**: `docs/testing/REGRESSION_ANALYSIS_SEPT27_TO_OCT15.md`

**Root Cause**: 374 commits in 18 days added incredible intelligence features but buried character personality under complexity. Fixes are straightforward and preserve all new features while restoring personality-first architecture.

**Impact**: Restore production quality, prevent future regressions, maintain character authenticity
