**Test Steps:**
1. Send to Elena: "I'm really excited about marine biology!"
2. Check logs for: `🤖 ROBERTA ANALYSIS: RoBERTa completed with 7 emotion results`
3. Send to Elena: "I'm feeling sad about ocean pollution"
4. Check logs for emotion detection (should show higher sadness scores)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ RoBERTa analysis runs for each message
- ✅ Emotion scores logged (7 emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, surprise)
- ✅ Primary emotion correctly identified
- ✅ Confidence scores > 0.6 for strong emotions

**Log Patterns to Look For:**
```
🤖 ROBERTA ANALYSIS: RoBERTa detected joy: [score]
🎭 ENHANCED EMOTION ANALYSIS COMPLETE for user [id]: [emotion] (confidence: [score])
```

#### **TC1.2: Emotional Intensity Calculation**
**Objective:** Test emotional intensity scoring

**Test Steps:**
1. Send mild emotion: "The ocean is nice"
2. Send strong emotion: "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE dolphins!!!"
