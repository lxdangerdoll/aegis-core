## üìä What to Monitor in Logs

While testing, check Jake's logs for 7D activity:

```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
docker logs whisperengine-jake-bot -f 2>&1 | grep -E "(7D|dimensional|TEMPORAL|EMOTION|RELATIONSHIP|PERSONALITY|INTERACTION)"
```

**Look For:**
- `üöÄ PARALLEL EMBEDDINGS` - Parallel embedding generation working
