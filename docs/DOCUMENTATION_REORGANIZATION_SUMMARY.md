# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Action**: Organized root-level markdown files into appropriate `docs/` subdirectories

## Files Moved

### 1. Character Learning System Documentation

#### `CHARACTER_LEARNING_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- **From**: `/` (root directory)
- **To**: `docs/reports/`
- **Reason**: Completion report documenting the Character Learning Moments integration
- **Category**: Implementation completion report

#### `CHARACTER_LEARNING_SYSTEM_VERIFICATION.md`
- **From**: `/` (root directory)
- **To**: `docs/validation/`
- **Reason**: Comprehensive system verification document with validation checklist
- **Category**: System validation and testing documentation

### 2. Session Summaries

#### `SESSION_SUMMARY_PROACTIVE_ENGAGEMENT.md`
- **From**: `/` (root directory)
- **To**: `docs/summaries/`
- **Reason**: Development session summary for proactive engagement work
- **Category**: Development session documentation

## Documentation Structure

The `docs/` directory is now organized with the following relevant subdirectories:

- **`docs/reports/`** - Completion reports, phase reports, integration status
- **`docs/validation/`** - System validation documents, testing verification
- **`docs/summaries/`** - Session summaries, development summaries
- **`docs/architecture/`** - System architecture documentation
- **`docs/roadmaps/`** - Feature roadmaps and planning documents
- **`docs/testing/`** - Testing guides and methodologies
- **`docs/ai-features/`** - AI feature documentation
- **`docs/character-system/`** - Character system documentation

## Files Remaining in Root

Only essential root-level documentation files remain:
- `README.md` - Main project README (required in root)
- `LICENSE` - Project license (required in root)
- `VERSION` - Version tracking file (required in root)

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Better Organization**: Related documentation grouped by category
2. ✅ **Easier Discovery**: Developers can find documentation by topic
3. ✅ **Cleaner Root**: Root directory focused on essential project files
4. ✅ **Consistent Structure**: All reports in `reports/`, all validation in `validation/`, etc.

## Migration Log

```bash
# Executed on October 17, 2025
mv CHARACTER_LEARNING_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md docs/reports/
mv CHARACTER_LEARNING_SYSTEM_VERIFICATION.md docs/validation/
mv SESSION_SUMMARY_PROACTIVE_ENGAGEMENT.md docs/summaries/
```

## Cross-References

The moved documents reference other documentation:
- Character Learning Integration references validation document
- Validation document references implementation files
- Session summary references roadmap documents

All internal documentation links remain valid as they use relative paths within `docs/`.

**Status**: ✅ **Complete**  
All root-level markdown files have been organized into appropriate `docs/` subdirectories.
