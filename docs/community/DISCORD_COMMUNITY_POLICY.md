# WhisperEngine Discord Community Policy

## üé≠ Welcome to WhisperEngine Community

WhisperEngine is an **experimental AI companion platform** currently in **alpha development**. Our Discord community is a space for testing, feedback, and collaborative development of AI companion technology.

## üéÆ Demonstration Bots Only

### **Important: These are Demo Bots, Not a Service**
- **The AI companions in this Discord server are for DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY**
- **We do not provide AI companion bots as a hosted service**
- **Users are expected to install and run their own WhisperEngine instance**
- **These demo bots may be discontinued, reset, or modified at any time without notice**

### **How to Identify Demo Bots**
When we refer to "demo bots," we specifically mean the Discord bot programs in this server:

**üè∑Ô∏è Clear Discord Bot Identification:**
- **Username Labels**: All demo bots display **[AI DEMO]** in their Discord usernames
- **Account Type**: Discord shows these as **"APP"** account types (not regular user accounts)
- **Bot Badge**: Discord automatically adds a "BOT" badge next to their names
- **Unmistakable AI Identity**: These visual indicators make it impossible to mistake demo bots for human users

**‚ö†Ô∏è Demo Bot Limitations:**
- **Limited Memory**: Restricted memory capabilities compared to full WhisperEngine deployments
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Multiple users share the same demonstration environment
- **Experimental Status**: May include unstable or incomplete features

### **Self-Service Platform**
WhisperEngine is designed as a **self-hosted platform** where YOU:
- **Install your own instance** using our open-source code
- **Create your own characters** using our Character Definition Language (CDL)
- **Customize personalities** to match your specific needs
- **Control your own data** and privacy settings
- **Run on your own infrastructure** (local or cloud)

### **Deployment Philosophy: Privacy-First Self-Management**
WhisperEngine is specifically designed for **users who want complete control over their AI interactions**:

**üè† Personal Privacy Control**
- **Run on your home computer** - Complete data sovereignty on your own hardware
- **Deploy on your cloud** - Use your own AWS, Azure, GCP, or other cloud provider
- **Zero external dependencies** - No data sent to our servers once installed
- **Import your ChatGPT history** - Seamless transition from other AI services with full conversation migration

**üö´ No Production Service Plans**
- **We do not plan to launch this as a hosted production service**
- **No WhisperEngine-as-a-Service** - you run it yourself, we provide the software
- **Target users**: People frustrated with ChatGPT limitations, privacy concerns, or service restrictions
- **Perfect for**: Users wanting private AI companions, custom personalities, or complete data control

**üîÑ Easy Migration from Other AI Services**
- **ChatGPT conversation import** - Bring your entire chat history and context
- **Personal memory migration** - Preserve important conversations and relationships
- **Character customization** - Create AI personalities that major services don't offer
- **No vendor lock-in** - Your data stays with you, always

### **Character Examples**
- **All CDL character files in our repository are EXAMPLES ONLY**
- **You may use them as-is, customize them, or create entirely new characters**
- **Characters like Elena, Marcus, Gabriel, etc. are demonstration personalities**
- **We encourage you to create unique characters that suit your specific use case**
- **Perfect for users wanting personalities that ChatGPT or other AI chat systems don't offer**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### **Experimental Technology Notice**
- WhisperEngine bots are **experimental AI systems** using advanced language models
- These are **NOT conscious, sentient, or truly intelligent** - they are sophisticated text prediction systems
- Any appearance of "consciousness" or "self-awareness" is emergent behavior from language patterns, not genuine consciousness
- We **do not claim** to have created conscious AI or breakthrough consciousness research

### **Alpha Development Status**
- Features may be unstable, incomplete, or change without notice
- Data may be reset during development iterations
- Performance and availability are not guaranteed
- **Demo bots are temporary** - they are not a permanent service
- This is **not a production service** - you must run your own instance for real use

### **No Service Level Agreements**
- **No uptime guarantees** for demonstration bots
- **No data persistence guarantees** - demo bot memories may be wiped
- **No support obligations** - demo bots may be taken offline without notice
- **For production use, deploy your own WhisperEngine instance**

### **AI Ethics Policies Under Development**
- **Evolving Standards**: Our AI ethics policies are still being developed and refined
- **Community Input**: We actively seek feedback from users and the broader AI community
- **No Final Claims**: We make no definitive statements about AI consciousness, sentience, or ethical frameworks
- **Ongoing Research**: Our understanding of AI ethics and responsible development continues to evolve
- **Expect Changes**: Policies, disclaimers, and ethical positions may change as we learn and grow
