# WhisperEngine Discord Community Policy

## üé≠ Welcome to Our Creative AI Community

WhisperEngine is a **creative AI companion platform** designed for people seeking alternatives to corporate AI limitations. Our Discord community is a space for exploring creative AI interactions, testing different personality types, and connecting with fellow creators who value AI that serves imagination and meaningful dialogue.
