# WhisperEngine Discord Welcome Guide

## 🎭 Welcome to Our Creative AI Experiment!

Welcome to the **WhisperEngine community** - a space for exploring creative AI companion interactions! You're joining a diverse community of developers, artists, curious users, and creative experimenters discovering what's possible when AI becomes a canvas for imagination and meaningful dialogue.

## 🎮 Important: Demo Bots for Exploration!

### **🌟 These Are Creative Demonstration Bots**
**The AI companions in this Discord server are for EXPLORATION and CREATIVE EXPERIMENTATION.** 

- **🎨 Experience different personality types** and interaction styles
- **🏠 Install your own WhisperEngine** to unlock the full creative potential
- **⏰ Demo bots may be offline or reset** as we continue developing
- **📱 Think of this as a "creative playground" to explore possibilities**

### **🏷️ How to Identify Demo Bots**
When we say "demo bots," we mean the Discord bot programs clearly marked as such:

**Discord's Built-in Bot Identification:**
- **[AI DEMO] Username Labels**: All our demo bots display **[AI DEMO]** in their Discord usernames
- **"APP" Account Type**: Discord shows these as **"APP"** account types (not regular user accounts)  
- **BOT Badge**: Discord automatically adds a "BOT" badge next to their names
- **Impossible to Confuse**: These visual indicators make it clear they are bot programs, not human users

### **🛠️ WhisperEngine is a Creative Platform**
This Discord server lets you **explore the possibilities**, but for deep creative work you'll want to:

1. **📥 Install WhisperEngine** on your own computer or server
2. **🎭 Create unique characters** using our Character Definition Language (CDL)
