# Session Timeout Fix - Removed 90-Minute Hard Cap

## Problem

WhisperEngine had a **critical UX bug** where active conversation sessions would be forcibly reset after 90 minutes, even if users were actively chatting every 10 minutes.

### Root Cause

`src/conversation/boundary_manager.py` lines 519-524 implemented **TWO timeout conditions**:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (BEFORE FIX):
if time_since_activity > self.session_keepalive:  # 15min inactivity
    session.state = ConversationState.PAUSED
elif session_duration > self.session_timeout:  # 90min HARD CAP ‚ùå
    session.state = ConversationState.PAUSED
```

The second condition (`session_duration > self.session_timeout`) would trigger at 90 minutes **regardless of user activity**, causing:
- Active conversations to abruptly reset
- Loss of conversation flow continuity
- Poor user experience for extended chat sessions
- Violation of design goal: "users can chat indefinitely if active"

### Documentation Contradiction

Line 157 comment incorrectly claimed: "can chat for 90min if responding every 15min"

**Actual behavior**: Session would ALWAYS pause at 90 minutes, even with constant activity.

## Solution

**Removed the absolute timeout check entirely** - only keepalive timeout remains.

### Fixed Code

```python
# FIXED CODE (AFTER):
# üö® SMART SESSION TIMEOUT: Keepalive-based only
# REMOVED absolute timeout - users should be able to chat indefinitely if active
# Only inactivity timeout applies (default 15 minutes)
time_since_activity = timestamp - session.last_activity

# Check keepalive timeout (has user been inactive too long?)
if time_since_activity > self.session_keepalive:
    session.state = ConversationState.PAUSED
    logger.debug(f"Session timed out for user {user_id} (inactive for {time_since_activity.total_seconds()/60:.1f}min)")
```

### Updated Documentation

Updated `__init__` docstring to reflect new behavior:

```python
Session Timeout Strategy:
- Sessions remain active as long as user responds within keepalive_minutes
- NO absolute timeout - users can chat indefinitely if they remain active
- Example: 15min keepalive = session pauses after 15min of inactivity, but no maximum duration
```

**Legacy Parameter**: `session_timeout_minutes` parameter kept for API compatibility but no longer enforced.

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Active conversations reset at 90 minutes
- ‚ùå Poor UX for long chat sessions
- ‚ùå Contradicted smart keepalive design goal
- ‚ùå Documentation mismatched actual behavior

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Users can chat indefinitely if active (messaging within 15min)
- ‚úÖ Sessions only pause after 15 minutes of actual inactivity
- ‚úÖ Aligns with user requirement: "We don't want long chat sessions to abruptly 'reset' on users"
- ‚úÖ Documentation accurately reflects behavior

## Validation

### Test Scenario
1. User starts conversation with Jake bot
2. User sends message every 10 minutes
3. Continue for 100+ minutes

**Expected Result**: Conversation continues uninterrupted as long as messages sent within 15-minute windows.

### Files Modified
- `src/conversation/boundary_manager.py`:
  - Lines 515-523: Removed absolute timeout check
  - Lines 149-161: Updated docstring documentation
  - Lines 168-170: Added legacy parameter comment

## Configuration

### Current Defaults
- **Keepalive Timeout**: 15 minutes (configurable via `session_keepalive_minutes`)
- **Absolute Timeout**: REMOVED (legacy parameter `session_timeout_minutes` unused)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Keepalive timeout can be customized per bot:
SESSION_KEEPALIVE_MINUTES=15  # Session pauses after 15min inactivity
```

## Related Systems

### Active Usage
`src/handlers/events.py` line 882 actively uses `boundary_manager.process_message()` in message processing pipeline.

### Memory Integration
- Sessions are in-memory only (Redis removed)
- Conversation context persists via Qdrant vector memory
- Session pauses don't lose conversation history
- Memory system maintains continuity across session boundaries

## Testing

### Automated Validation
Run conversation context validation across all bots:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/validate_conversation_context.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start conversation with any bot via Discord
2. Message every 10-12 minutes for 2+ hours
3. Verify conversation context maintained throughout
4. Verify session doesn't reset at 90-minute mark

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Add configurable absolute timeout for edge cases (e.g., 24 hours)
- Track session duration metrics to understand actual usage patterns
- Implement gradual context compression for very long sessions
- Add session resumption hints after inactivity pauses

### Monitoring
Track these metrics to validate fix effectiveness:
- Average session duration
- Sessions exceeding 90 minutes
- User satisfaction with long conversations
- Context quality in extended sessions

## Conclusion

This fix aligns WhisperEngine's session management with user expectations and design goals. Users can now have extended conversations without arbitrary time limits, improving overall UX and conversation quality.

**Bottom Line**: Chat sessions now only reset due to actual inactivity (15min), NOT arbitrary duration limits.
