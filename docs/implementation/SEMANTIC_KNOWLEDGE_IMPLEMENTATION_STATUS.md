# Semantic Knowledge Graph - Implementation Status

## Phase 1: PostgreSQL Schema & Foundation ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE & APPLIED
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema designed and created (`sql/semantic_knowledge_graph_schema.sql`)
- ✅ Architectural design documented (`docs/architecture/SEMANTIC_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_DESIGN.md`)
- ✅ Schema applied to database: `whisperengine` (October 4, 2025)
- ✅ Tables created and verified:
  - `fact_entities` - Entity storage with full-text search
  - `user_fact_relationships` - Knowledge graph core with character awareness
  - `entity_relationships` - Graph edges for entity connections
  - `character_interactions` - Character-specific conversation tracking
- ✅ Helper functions deployed:
  - `update_updated_at()` trigger
  - `discover_similar_entities()` using pg_trgm similarity
  - `get_user_facts_with_relations()` for 1-2 hop graph traversal
- ✅ Comprehensive indexing (GIN for JSONB/full-text, B-tree for lookups)

**Database Verification**:
```bash
# Verify tables exist
docker exec whisperengine-multi-postgres psql -U whisperengine -d whisperengine -c "\dt" | grep fact
# Result: All 4 tables confirmed ✅
```

## Phase 2: SemanticKnowledgeRouter Implementation ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE
- ✅ Core router created (`src/knowledge/semantic_router.py`)
- ✅ Query intent analysis with pattern matching
- ✅ Multi-modal data routing (PostgreSQL/Qdrant/InfluxDB/CDL)
- ✅ Intent types defined:
  - `FACTUAL_RECALL` - "What foods do I like?"
  - `CONVERSATION_STYLE` - "How did we talk about X?"
  - `TEMPORAL_ANALYSIS` - "How have my preferences changed?"
  - `PERSONALITY_KNOWLEDGE` - CDL character background
  - `RELATIONSHIP_DISCOVERY` - "What's similar to X?"
  - `ENTITY_SEARCH` - "Find entities about Y"
- ✅ PostgreSQL integration methods:
  - `get_user_facts()` - Retrieve user facts with filters
  - `get_character_aware_facts()` - Character-specific context
  - `store_user_fact()` - Store with automatic similarity discovery
  - `search_entities()` - Full-text search across entities
- ✅ Factory function for easy integration
- ✅ Bot initialization integrated (`src/core/bot.py`)
  - `initialize_knowledge_router()` method added
  - Scheduled for async initialization in `initialize_all()`
  - Requires `postgres_pool` from Phase 4 components

**Architecture**:
- Smart query routing based on semantic intent
- Automatic entity relationship discovery using trigram similarity
- Character-aware fact storage and retrieval
- Confidence tracking for gradual knowledge building

---

## Phase 3: Knowledge Extraction Pipeline

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

### Completed:
- ✅ Entity extraction method `_extract_entity_from_content()` - Simple pattern-based extraction
- ✅ Knowledge extraction method `_extract_and_store_knowledge()` - Detects factual statements
- ✅ Integrated into `MessageProcessor.process_message()` - Phase 9b after memory storage
- ✅ Pattern-based factual detection for:
  - food_preference (likes/dislikes)
  - drink_preference (likes/dislikes)
  - hobby_preference (enjoys)
  - place_visited (visited)
- ✅ PostgreSQL storage with automatic similarity discovery
- ✅ Character-aware tracking (mentioned_by_character)
- ✅ Emotional context integration from AI components

### Implementation Details:
**Pattern Detection**: Simple keyword-based for Phase 3, will be enhanced with semantic analysis
**Entity Extraction**: Takes first 1-3 meaningful words after pattern (filters articles)
**Storage Flow**:
1. Detect factual patterns in user message
2. Extract entity name from content
3. Store in PostgreSQL via `knowledge_router.store_user_fact()`
4. Auto-discover similar entities using trigram similarity
5. Log success/failure for debugging

**Integration Point**: 
- Added `_extract_and_store_knowledge()` method to `MessageProcessor`
- Called in Phase 9b of `process_message()` flow
- Runs after vector memory storage, before response return
- Non-blocking - failures don't affect conversation flow

### Testing Commands:
### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Test Elena with food memory
# 1. Start Elena bot
./multi-bot.sh start elena

# 2. Discord messages:
# User: "I love pizza"
# → Should detect food_preference, extract "pizza", store in PostgreSQL

# User: "I really enjoy hiking"
# → Should detect hobby_preference, extract "hiking", store in PostgreSQL

# 3. Check PostgreSQL storage:
docker exec whisperengine-multi-postgres psql -U whisperengine -d whisperengine -c "
SELECT 
    fe.entity_name, 
    fe.entity_type,
    ufr.relationship_type,
    ufr.confidence, 
    ufr.emotional_context,
    ufr.mentioned_by_character
FROM user_fact_relationships ufr
JOIN fact_entities fe ON ufr.entity_id = fe.id
WHERE ufr.user_id = 'USER_UNIVERSAL_ID_HERE'
ORDER BY ufr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
"

# 4. Test similar entity discovery:
docker exec whisperengine-multi-postgres psql -U whisperengine -d whisperengine -c "
SELECT * FROM entity_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type = 'similar_to' 
LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 3):
- Semantic entity extraction using FastEmbed/LLM
- Multi-word entity detection (e.g., "ginger beer", "rock climbing")
- Category classification (e.g., pizza → italian cuisine)
- Confidence scoring based on context
- LLM-assisted entity normalization

---

## Phase 4: Character Integration ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE & TESTED (October 4, 2025)

### Completed:
- ✅ Updated `CDLAIPromptIntegration.__init__()` to accept `knowledge_router` parameter
- ✅ Integrated fact retrieval into `_build_unified_prompt()` method
- ✅ Query intent analysis integration (analyzes user message for factual queries)
- ✅ Character-aware fact retrieval using `get_character_aware_facts()`
- ✅ Personality-first fact synthesis with formatting
- ✅ Updated `bot.py` to inject `knowledge_router` into character system after async initialization
- ✅ Updated `message_processor.py` fallback to pass `knowledge_router` if available
- ✅ Non-blocking integration - failures don't break conversation flow
- ✅ **TESTED**: Automated test confirms facts stored and retrieved naturally via Elena bot

### Implementation Details:

**CDL Integration Flow**:
1. `knowledge_router` initialized asynchronously in `bot.py` (waits for postgres_pool)
2. Once ready, `knowledge_router` injected into `character_system`
3. During prompt building, `_build_unified_prompt()` checks for factual intent
4. If query has factual intent (confidence > 0.3), retrieves character-aware facts
5. Facts formatted with personality-first synthesis instructions
6. Character interprets facts through their unique personality (Elena's metaphors, Marcus's analysis)

**Integration Points**:
```python
# bot.py - async initialization
async def initialize_knowledge_router(self):
    self.knowledge_router = create_semantic_knowledge_router(...)
    if self.character_system and self.knowledge_router:
        self.character_system.knowledge_router = self.knowledge_router

# cdl_ai_integration.py - fact retrieval
if self.knowledge_router:
    intent = await self.knowledge_router.analyze_query_intent(message_content)
    if intent.confidence > 0.3 and intent.intent_type.value in ['factual_recall', ...]:
        facts = await self.knowledge_router.get_character_aware_facts(...)
        # Format and add to prompt with personality synthesis
```

**Personality-First Synthesis**:
- Facts are NOT delivered robotically
- Each character interprets through their personality:
  - Elena (marine biologist): Adds ocean metaphors and scientific enthusiasm
  - Marcus (AI researcher): Adds analytical precision and technical context
  - Jake (photographer): Adds visual descriptions and adventure context
- Confidence markers guide gradual knowledge building
- Natural conversation weaving, not data dumps

### Testing Plan:

```bash
# Test Elena with food memory recall
# 1. Start Elena bot
./multi-bot.sh start elena

# 2. Discord messages:
# User: "I love pizza"
# → Should extract and store (already working from Phase 3)

# User: "What foods do I like?"
# → Intent analysis: factual_recall (confidence > 0.3)
# → Retrieves facts from PostgreSQL
# → Elena responds with marine metaphors + facts naturally woven in

# 3. Test personality-first synthesis:
# Elena: "Ah, just like schools of fish have their favorite currents, you've 
#        developed quite a taste for pizza! 🍕 Your palate seems to favor..."
#        (NOT: "According to my database, you like: pizza")

# 4. Check logs for integration:
docker logs whisperengine-elena-bot --tail 50 | grep "KNOWLEDGE"
# Should see:
# 🎯 KNOWLEDGE: Query intent detected: factual_recall (confidence: 0.85)
# 🎯 KNOWLEDGE: Added 5 structured facts across 2 categories
```

### Success Metrics:

**Functionality**:
- ✅ Query "What foods do I like?" triggers factual_recall intent
- ✅ Facts retrieved from PostgreSQL via `get_character_aware_facts()`
- ✅ Facts formatted with confidence indicators and grouped by type
- ✅ Personality synthesis instructions added to prompt
- ✅ Character responds with authentic voice, not robotic delivery

**Integration Quality**:
- ✅ Non-blocking - failures don't break conversation
- ✅ Async initialization properly waits for postgres_pool
- ✅ Fallback path supports knowledge_router if available
- ✅ Logging provides clear visibility into fact retrieval

**Character Authenticity**:
- ✅ Elena adds marine biology metaphors to food preferences
- ✅ Marcus adds analytical precision to fact synthesis
- ✅ Facts feel natural, not like database queries
- ✅ Confidence tracking supports gradual knowledge building

## Testing Plan

### Phase 2 Testing (Router Integration): ✅ COMPLETE
```bash
# Test intent analysis
python -c "
import asyncio
from src.knowledge.semantic_router import create_semantic_knowledge_router
router = create_semantic_knowledge_router(postgres_pool)
intent = asyncio.run(router.analyze_query_intent('What foods do I like?'))
print(f'Intent: {intent.intent_type.value}, Confidence: {intent.confidence}')
"

# Test fact storage and retrieval
# (Integration test after Phase 3 extraction pipeline)
```

### Phase 3 Testing (Extraction): ✅ COMPLETE
```bash
# Test Elena with food memory
# 1. Start Elena bot
./multi-bot.sh start elena

# 2. Discord messages:
# User: "I love pizza"
# → Should detect food_preference, extract "pizza", store in PostgreSQL

# User: "I really enjoy hiking"
# → Should detect hobby_preference, extract "hiking", store in PostgreSQL

# 3. Check PostgreSQL storage:
docker exec whisperengine-multi-postgres psql -U whisperengine -d whisperengine -c "
SELECT 
    fe.entity_name, 
    fe.entity_type,
    ufr.relationship_type,
    ufr.confidence, 
    ufr.emotional_context,
    ufr.mentioned_by_character
FROM user_fact_relationships ufr
JOIN fact_entities fe ON ufr.entity_id = fe.id
WHERE ufr.user_id = 'USER_UNIVERSAL_ID_HERE'
ORDER BY ufr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
"

# 4. Test similar entity discovery:
docker exec whisperengine-multi-postgres psql -U whisperengine -d whisperengine -c "
SELECT * FROM entity_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type = 'similar_to' 
LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Phase 4 Testing (Character Integration): ✅ COMPLETE
```bash
# Test personality-first synthesis
# 1. Start Elena bot
./multi-bot.sh start elena

# 2. Store some facts first:
# User: "I love pizza"
# User: "I enjoy hiking"  
# User: "I visited Tokyo"

# 3. Test fact retrieval with personality synthesis:
# User: "What foods do I like?"
# Expected Elena response:
# - Marine biology metaphors ("like schools of fish have favorite currents")
# - Natural fact weaving (NOT robotic: "According to database...")
# - Emotional warmth and engagement

# User: "What do you know about my hobbies?"
# Expected Elena response:
# - Enthusiastic personality preserved
# - Facts woven naturally into conversation
# - Character-consistent interpretation

# 4. Check integration logs:
docker logs whisperengine-elena-bot --tail 50 | grep "KNOWLEDGE"
# Should show:
# 🎯 KNOWLEDGE: Query intent detected: factual_recall (confidence: 0.XX)
# 🎯 KNOWLEDGE: Added N structured facts across M categories

# 5. Test with Marcus for different personality:
./multi-bot.sh start marcus
# Marcus should give analytical, precise responses
# Different from Elena's warm, metaphorical style
```

## Performance Expectations

Based on design analysis (see `SEMANTIC_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_DESIGN.md`):

- **Simple fact retrieval** (85% of queries): <1ms PostgreSQL query
- **2-hop relationships** (10% of queries): 1-5ms with recursive CTE
- **Complex traversals** (4% of queries): 10-50ms for 3+ hops
- **Full-text search**: ~2-5ms with GIN indexes
- **Auto-discovery**: ~5-10ms for similar entity detection

PostgreSQL handles WhisperEngine's query patterns excellently without Neo4j complexity.
