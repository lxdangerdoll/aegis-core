## üìà Velocity and Capacity Planning

### Team Capacity Calculation
```
Total Team Hours per Sprint = Team Size √ó Sprint Days √ó Hours per Day √ó Focus Factor

Example:
6 developers √ó 10 sprint days √ó 8 hours √ó 0.75 focus factor = 360 hours

Story Point Capacity = Team Velocity (average points per sprint)
- Sprint 1-3: Establish baseline velocity
- Sprint 4+: Use rolling 3-sprint average
```

### Velocity Tracking
| Sprint | Committed | Completed | Velocity | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1.1    | 40        | 35        | 35       | Learning curve with new domain |
| 1.2    | 38        | 40        | 40       | Team hitting stride |
| 1.3    | 42        | 38        | 38       | Integration challenges |
| Average| -         | -         | 38       | Use for next sprint planning |

### Capacity Considerations
- **Team Member Availability**: Vacation, training, meetings
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate 20% capacity for maintenance
- **Learning Curve**: Reduce capacity for new technologies
- **External Dependencies**: Buffer time for waiting on others
