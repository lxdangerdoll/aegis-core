## 🔧 Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Memory Efficiency
**Problem**: Character self-memories could grow very large over time
**Solution**: 
- Implement memory importance weighting
- Compress older, less important memories
- Use hierarchical memory structure (core → detailed)

### Challenge 2: Computational Cost
**Problem**: Running autonomous simulations for many characters
**Solution**:
- Batch processing for multiple characters
- Optimize simulation frequency based on user engagement
- Use lightweight simulation for inactive characters

### Challenge 3: Character Consistency
**Problem**: Ensuring character stays true to personality over time
**Solution**:
- Implement personality drift detection
- Regular consistency validation checks
- Character "personality anchor" system

### Challenge 4: Realistic Growth
**Problem**: Balancing character evolution with personality stability
**Solution**:
- Cap growth rates based on personality traits
- Implement realistic timescales for change
- Track growth history for reversibility

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
