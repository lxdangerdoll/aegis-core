## ðŸš€ **Model Selection Insights**

### **Mistral vs Claude Performance**
**Critical Discovery**: Mistral models significantly outperform Claude for CDL compliance and mode switching.

| Capability | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Mistral | Improvement |
|------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Creative Mode** | 95%+ | 95%+ | Equal |
| **Technical Mode** | 65-68% | 95%+ | +30% |
| **Mode Switching** | 68.8% | 91.3% | +22.5% |
| **CDL Compliance** | 67-68% | 95.6% | +28% |

**Root Cause**: Claude exhibits "creative bias" - tends to maintain poetic/metaphorical voice even when technical precision requested.

**Recommendation**: Use Mistral for multi-modal characters requiring strict mode adherence.
