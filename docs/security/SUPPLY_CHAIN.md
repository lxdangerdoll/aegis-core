# Supply Chain Security Guide

WhisperEngine implements comprehensive supply chain security measures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the software distribution pipeline.

## üîê Security Features

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Every WhisperEngine release includes a comprehensive SBOM in SPDX format that catalogs:

- **All Dependencies** - Direct and transitive dependencies with exact versions
- **License Information** - Complete license compliance data for all components
- **Vulnerability Data** - Known security issues and remediation status
- **Build Metadata** - Build environment and toolchain information

#### Accessing SBOM Artifacts

SBOM artifacts are automatically generated for each release and available in multiple formats:

```bash
# Download the latest SBOM
curl -L https://github.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/releases/latest/download/sbom-latest.spdx.json

# Download SBOM for specific version
curl -L https://github.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/releases/download/v1.2.3/sbom-1234567.spdx.json
```

#### SBOM Analysis

Use standard SPDX tools to analyze the SBOM:

```bash
# View all packages and licenses
cat sbom-latest.spdx.json | jq '.packages[] | {name: .name, version: .versionInfo, license: .licenseConcluded}'

# Find packages with specific licenses
cat sbom-latest.spdx.json | jq '.packages[] | select(.licenseConcluded | contains("MIT"))'

# Check for known vulnerabilities
syft packages sbom-latest.spdx.json -o table
grype sbom:sbom-latest.spdx.json
```

### Container Security

#### Multi-Registry Distribution

WhisperEngine containers are distributed across multiple registries for redundancy:

| Registry | Image URL | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Docker Hub | `docker.io/whisperengine/whisperengine` | General public access |
| GitHub Container Registry | `ghcr.io/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine` | GitHub-integrated workflows |
| Custom Registry | Configure via CI/CD | Enterprise private registries |

#### Digital Signatures

All container images are signed using Cosign for authenticity verification:

```bash
# Install cosign (if not already installed)
# See: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/

# Verify container signature
cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp=".*@github.com" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  whisperengine/whisperengine:latest

# Verify specific tag
cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp=".*@github.com" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  whisperengine/whisperengine:v1.2.3
```

#### Provenance Attestations

Each container includes build provenance metadata:

```bash
# Download and verify provenance
cosign download attestation whisperengine/whisperengine:latest | jq .

# Verify build environment
cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=".*@github.com" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  whisperengine/whisperengine:latest
```

### Vulnerability Management

#### Automated Scanning

The CI/CD pipeline includes automated vulnerability scanning:

- **Source Code Scanning** - CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning** - Automated dependency vulnerability checks
- **Container Scanning** - Multi-layer container image security analysis
- **Supply Chain Analysis** - Third-party component risk assessment

#### Security Reports

Vulnerability reports are available for each release:

```bash
# Download vulnerability report
curl -L https://github.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/releases/latest/download/security-report.json

# View high-severity vulnerabilities
cat security-report.json | jq '.vulnerabilities[] | select(.severity == "HIGH")'
```

## üè¢ Enterprise Compliance

### Compliance Standards

WhisperEngine's supply chain security supports compliance with:

- **NIST SP 800-218** - Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)
- **SLSA Level 3** - Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts
- **SPDX 2.3** - Software Package Data Exchange standard
- **SCVS** - Software Component Verification Standard

### Audit Trail

Complete audit trails are maintained for:

- **Build Provenance** - Full build environment and process documentation
- **Dependency Resolution** - Exact dependency versions and sources
- **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability assessment results and remediation
- **Release Signing** - Cryptographic signatures and verification chains

### Policy Enforcement

Configure organizational policies for WhisperEngine deployments:

```yaml
# Example policy file (policy.yaml)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: whisperengine-security-policy
spec:
  containers:
    - name: whisperengine
      signature:
        required: true
        issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      vulnerabilities:
        maxSeverity: "MEDIUM"
        exceptions:
          - CVE-2023-XXXXX  # Known false positive
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### CI/CD Pipeline Security

The WhisperEngine build pipeline implements security best practices:

#### Least Privilege Access
- **Minimal Permissions** - Each job has only the permissions it needs
- **Short-lived Tokens** - Temporary credentials with automatic rotation
- **Scoped Access** - Granular access controls for different pipeline stages

#### Reproducible Builds
- **Pinned Dependencies** - Exact version specifications for all components
- **Hermetic Builds** - Isolated build environments with no external network access
- **Build Attestations** - Cryptographic proof of build process integrity

#### Secure Artifact Storage
- **Immutable Storage** - Artifacts cannot be modified after publication
- **Access Logging** - Complete audit trail of artifact access
- **Retention Policies** - Automated cleanup with configurable retention periods

### Integration with Security Tools

WhisperEngine integrates with common enterprise security tools:

#### SIEM Integration
```bash
# Export security events to SIEM
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SIEM_TOKEN" \
  -d @security-events.json \
  https://your-siem.company.com/api/events
```

#### Vulnerability Scanners
```bash
# Integration with enterprise vulnerability scanners
grype whisperengine/whisperengine:latest -o json | \
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- https://your-scanner.company.com/api/import
```

#### Compliance Reporting
```bash
# Generate compliance report
python scripts/generate-compliance-report.py \
  --sbom sbom-latest.spdx.json \
  --format nist-ssdf \
  --output compliance-report.pdf
```

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Issue Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** security@whisperengine.ai with details
3. **Include** steps to reproduce and potential impact
4. **Expect** acknowledgment within 24 hours

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Assessment** - Security team evaluates the issue (1-3 days)
2. **Fix Development** - Patch development and testing (1-2 weeks)
3. **Release Coordination** - Coordinated disclosure with stakeholders
4. **Public Disclosure** - CVE assignment and public notification
5. **Post-Incident Review** - Process improvement and documentation

### Emergency Response

For critical security issues affecting production deployments:

- **Emergency Hotline**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (24/7 for enterprise customers)
- **Slack Channel**: #whisperengine-security (for enterprise Slack integrations)
- **Email**: security-emergency@whisperengine.ai
