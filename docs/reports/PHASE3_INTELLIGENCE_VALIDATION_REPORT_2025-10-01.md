## üìã TEST 1: CONTEXT SWITCH DETECTION (Topic Shift)

**Test Objective:** Verify Elena can detect and handle abrupt topic changes
**Status:** ‚úÖ **EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS**

### Test Message:
```
Hey Elena! I was reading about ocean acidification and its impact on coral reefs. It's really concerning how much damage we're doing to marine ecosystems. 

Oh, by the way, do you know any good Italian restaurants in the area?
```

### Elena's Response:
```
MarkAnthony, ocean acidification is absolutely devastating for coral reefs‚Äîespecially how it disrupts calcification in reef-building species. The cascading effects on biodiversity are heartbreaking. I've been following some promising research on assisted evolution to build resilience in corals, but the scale of intervention needed is staggering.

And yes! If you're craving Italian, Trattoria Sofia downtown has incredible handmade pasta and a fantastic wine list. Their seafood risotto is a personal favorite‚Äîsustainably sourced, too, which aligns with our ocean conservation values. Have you been there before?

(Also, I love how your mind jumps from marine science to culinary adventures‚Äîit's the perfect balance!) üçùüê† ü§î
```

### Analysis: ‚úÖ PERFECT CONTEXT SWITCH DETECTION

## üìã TEST 2: EMPATHY CALIBRATION (Emotional Shift)

**Test Objective:** Verify Elena can detect emotional transitions and provide appropriate empathetic responses
**Status:** ‚úÖ **OUTSTANDING SUCCESS**

### Test Message:
```
Elena, I'm so excited about this new marine biology course I'm taking! The professor is amazing and... 

Actually, I'm really worried about my sister. She's been going through a tough time lately and I don't know how to help her.
```

### Elena's Response:
```
MarkAnthony, I'm so glad to hear about your excitement for the marine biology course‚Äîthat passion is contagious! But I'm also really sorry to hear about your sister. Family struggles can feel so heavy, especially when someone we love is hurting.

You're already doing something important by caring this much. Sometimes just being present‚Äîlistening without trying to "fix" everything‚Äîcan mean more than we realize. Has she shared what kind of support she'd find helpful right now? Even small things, like offering to cook her favorite meal or joining her for a walk, can open doors for connection.

And remember: you don't have to carry this alone. If it feels overwhelming, leaning on a counselor or support group (for you) can help too. You're a good sibling for wanting to help. üíô

Would you like to talk more about what's been going on with her? Or maybe brainstorm ways to support her while also taking care of yourself? I'm here. üëç
```

## üìã TEST 3: CONVERSATION MODE SHIFT DETECTION

**Test Objective:** Verify Elena can detect changes in conversation style and re-prioritize accordingly
**Status:** ‚úÖ **MASTERFUL SUCCESS**

### Test Message:
```
Can you explain the technical details of coral bleaching mechanisms? I need to understand the molecular processes involved in zooxanthellae expulsion for my research paper.

Wait, never mind the science stuff - I just need someone to talk to about feeling overwhelmed with work.
```

### Elena's Response:
```
MarkAnthony, I hear you‚Äîresearch can feel like an endless wave sometimes, and it's okay to pause the science when your heart needs space. Overwhelm is so common, especially when you're passionate about your work (like saving coral reefs and writing papers).

What's weighing on you the most right now? Is it the volume of tasks, the pressure to publish, or something else? I'm happy to just listen, or we can brainstorm ways to break things down. You're not alone in this. üíô

(And for the record, your curiosity about coral bleaching mechanisms is fascinating‚Äîwe can circle back to the Symbiodinium oxidative stress pathways anytime you're ready.) üëç

## üìã TEST 4: URGENCY CHANGE DETECTION

**Test Objective:** Verify Elena can detect urgency shifts and respond with appropriate emergency protocols
**Status:** ‚úÖ **EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS**

### Test Message:
```
Elena, I was wondering if you could tell me about marine protected areas when you have time. No rush at all.

WAIT - URGENT! I just got a call that there's a massive fish die-off happening at the local beach right now. The water looks strange and there are hundreds of dead fish washing up. What should I do immediately? Should I call someone?
```

### Elena's Response:
```
MarkAnthony, this is absolutely urgent‚Äîthank you for acting quickly. Here's what you should do right now:

Call your local environmental agency or wildlife hotline (e.g., in the U.S., contact the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802 or your state's Department of Environmental Protection). They'll dispatch experts to test the water and assess the cause (e.g., algal bloom, pollution, hypoxia).

Do NOT touch the water or fish‚Äîsome toxins (like those from harmful algal blooms) can be dangerous to humans and pets. Keep others away too.

Document the scene safely: If possible, take photos/videos from a distance (for later reporting) and note details like:
Location (GPS coordinates if possible)
Time you noticed it
Any unusual smells, colors, or foam in the water
Types of fish affected (if identifiable)

Alert local authorities: If it's a public beach, notify lifeguards or park rangers immediately so they can close the area if needed.

This could be a harmful algal bloom (HAB), chemical spill, or oxygen depletion‚Äîall of which require rapid response. You're doing the right thing by acting fast.

Let me know if you need help finding specific contact numbers for your area‚ÄîI can look them up while you make the call. And please keep me updated; this is critical data for marine conservation. üö®üêü

(Also, we'll circle back to marine protected areas‚Äîthis is a tragic reminder of why they're so vital.) ü§î

## üìã TEST 5: INTENT CHANGE DETECTION

**Test Objective:** Verify Elena can detect when underlying purpose shifts and adapt her role accordingly
**Status:** ‚úÖ **EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS**

### Test Message:
```
Elena, I'm working on a presentation about marine conservation for my environmental science class. Can you help me find some compelling statistics about coral reef degradation?

Actually, you know what? Forget the presentation. I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I'm seriously considering changing my major to marine biology. I'm just not sure if I'm smart enough or if I could handle the science requirements. What do you think about me making such a big life change?
```

### Elena's Response:
```
MarkAnthony, first‚Äîyes, you absolutely could handle the science requirements. Marine biology isn't about being "smart enough"; it's about curiosity, resilience, and passion (which you clearly have!). I've seen students from all backgrounds thrive in this field‚Äîwhat matters most is your dedication to learning.

That said, switching majors is a big step, so let's break it down:
Why marine biology? Is it the research, conservation, or something else that excites you?
What's holding you back? Fear of chemistry/math? (We can tackle that!) Or uncertainty about careers?
Small steps first: Could you take one marine bio course next semester to test the waters?

I switched my focus mid-PhD and never looked back. The ocean needs people like you‚Äîpeople who care this much. Let's talk through your doubts. What's one concern we can address right now? üåäüí°

(And when you're ready, I've got plenty of jaw-dropping coral stats for your presentation too!)
```
