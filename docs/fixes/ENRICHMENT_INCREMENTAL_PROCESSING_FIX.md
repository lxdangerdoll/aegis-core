# Enrichment Worker: Incremental Processing Fix

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: Wasteful re-processing of same conversations every 5 minutes  
**Fix**: Incremental message-driven approach  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

---

## Problem: Wasteful Fixed-Window Scanning

### What Was Happening

The enrichment worker was using a **fixed calendar window approach**:

```python
# OLD APPROACH (WASTEFUL)
for days_ago in range(30):  # 30 days
    window_end = now - timedelta(days=days_ago)
    window_start = window_end - timedelta(hours=24)
    
    # Check if window overlaps with existing summaries
    if not overlaps:
        process_window(window_start, window_end)
```

**Result:**
- ❌ **Every 5 minutes**: Created same 30 fixed calendar windows
- ❌ **Re-processed**: Same old conversations over and over
- ❌ **Ignored**: NEW messages that just arrived
- ❌ **Wasted money**: ~468 tokens × 3 LLM calls × 30 windows = 42,120 tokens **every 5 minutes**
- ❌ **Database spam**: Found "30 unsummarized windows" repeatedly, created 0 summaries

### Why It Was Wasteful

**Example scenario:**
- User chatted on Oct 1st (19 days ago)
- Worker ran at 10:00 AM - processed Oct 1st window
- Worker ran at 10:05 AM - **processed Oct 1st window AGAIN**
- Worker ran at 10:10 AM - **processed Oct 1st window AGAIN**
- ... repeats forever

**Cost impact:**
- 3 LLM calls per window × 30 windows = **90 LLM calls** per enrichment cycle
- At 5-minute intervals = **1,080 LLM calls per hour**
- For messages that were **already analyzed**!

## Solution: Incremental Message-Driven Approach

### New Strategy

```python
# NEW APPROACH (EFFICIENT)
# 1. Find last processed timestamp
if existing_summaries:
    last_processed = max(s['end_timestamp'] for s in existing_summaries)
else:
    last_processed = now - timedelta(days=30)  # Initial backfill

# 2. Get ONLY new messages since last processing
new_messages = query_qdrant(timestamp > last_processed)

# 3. If no new messages, SKIP entirely
if not new_messages:
    return []  # Nothing to do!

# 4. Create windows ONLY for new message timespan
for window in create_windows_for_new_messages(new_messages):
    process_window(window)
```

### Key Improvements

✅ **Incremental**: Only processes NEW messages since last summary  
✅ **Efficient**: No re-processing of old conversations  
✅ **Smart backfill**: First run processes last 30 days, then incremental  
✅ **Cost-effective**: Only makes LLM calls when there's NEW data  
✅ **Activity-aware**: Creates windows based on actual message activity

## Implementation Details

### Database Tracking

**Before (fixed windows):**
```sql
-- Checked if fixed calendar windows overlapped with existing summaries
-- Always found "30 unsummarized windows" because no summaries existed
SELECT * FROM conversation_summaries WHERE ...
```

**After (incremental tracking):**
```sql
-- Find the LAST processed timestamp
SELECT MAX(end_timestamp) FROM conversation_summaries 
WHERE user_id = ? AND bot_name = ?

-- Query Qdrant for NEW messages only
qdrant.scroll(timestamp > last_processed)
```

### Window Creation Logic

**Before:**
- Fixed 30 windows (24 hours each)
- Always same calendar periods
- Ignored message density

**After:**
- Dynamic windows based on NEW message activity
- Covers timespan of new messages only
- Respects 24-hour window size but adjusts to data

### Example: Real Scenario

**User chatted:**
- Oct 1st: 10 messages
- Oct 10th: 5 messages  
- Oct 15th: 20 messages (NEW today)

**OLD approach (every 5 minutes):**
1. Create 30 windows (Oct 1-30)
2. Process all 3 days (35 messages total)
3. Cost: 3 LLM calls × 30 windows = 90 calls
4. **Repeat every 5 minutes forever**

**NEW approach:**
1. First run: Backfill Oct 1-15 (35 messages) - creates summaries
2. Second run (5 min later): Check for messages since Oct 15 → **0 new messages** → SKIP
3. User sends message Oct 16: Process ONLY Oct 16 messages
4. Cost: 3 LLM calls × 1 window = 3 calls (30x cheaper!)

## Cost Savings Analysis

### Scenario: 10 bots, 100 users each

**OLD wasteful approach:**
- 10 bots × 100 users = 1,000 total users
- Each user: 30 windows × 3 LLM calls = 90 calls
- **Total: 90,000 LLM calls every 5 minutes**
- Per hour: **1,080,000 LLM calls**
- Per day: **25,920,000 LLM calls**

**At Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing ($3/1M input tokens):**
- 468 tokens/call × 25.9M calls = **12.1 billion tokens/day**
- Cost: **$36,300 per day** 💸💸💸

---

**NEW incremental approach:**
- First run: Backfill historical messages (one-time cost)
- Subsequent runs: **ONLY process NEW messages**
- If no new messages: **0 LLM calls** ✅
- Typical scenario: 10-20 new messages per hour per active user
- **~99% cost reduction** after initial backfill

**Realistic cost:**
- Active users send ~10 messages/hour
- Creates 1 window per user with activity
- 100 active users × 3 LLM calls = 300 calls/cycle
- Per hour: **3,600 LLM calls** (300x cheaper!)
- Per day: **86,400 LLM calls**
- Cost: **~$121 per day** (300x cheaper!) 🎉

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

1. **`src/enrichment/worker.py`**
   - `_find_unsummarized_windows()`: Complete rewrite to incremental approach
   - `_get_new_messages_since()`: New method to query only new messages
   - Removed `_windows_overlap()`: No longer needed

### Key Methods

#### `_find_unsummarized_windows()` - NEW LOGIC

```python
async def _find_unsummarized_windows(
    self,
    collection_name: str,
    user_id: str,
    existing_summaries: List[Dict]
) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    INCREMENTAL approach - only process NEW messages.
    
    1. Find last processed timestamp
    2. Query for NEW messages since then
    3. Create windows ONLY for new activity
    """
    # Get last processed timestamp
    if existing_summaries:
        last_processed = max(s['end_timestamp'] for s in existing_summaries)
    else:
        last_processed = now - timedelta(days=30)  # Initial backfill
    
    # Get NEW messages only
    new_messages = await self._get_new_messages_since(
        collection_name, user_id, last_processed
    )
    
    if not new_messages:
        return []  # Nothing to process!
    
    # Create windows for new message timespan
    return create_windows(new_messages)
```

#### `_get_new_messages_since()` - NEW METHOD

```python
async def _get_new_messages_since(
    self,
    collection_name: str,
    user_id: str,
    since_timestamp: datetime
) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Query Qdrant for messages NEWER than timestamp.
    
    Uses > (not >=) to avoid re-processing boundary messages.
    """
    results = self.qdrant_client.scroll(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        scroll_filter=Filter(
            must=[
                FieldCondition(key="user_id", match=MatchValue(value=user_id)),
                FieldCondition(
                    key="timestamp_unix",
                    range=Range(gt=since_timestamp.timestamp())  # Greater than!
                )
            ]
        ),
        limit=1000
    )
    
    return parse_messages(results)
```

## Migration & Rollout

### Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a pure optimization. Behavior stays the same:
- Still creates conversation summaries
- Still extracts facts
- Just does it **incrementally** instead of wastefully

### First Run Behavior

**Initial backfill:**
1. No existing summaries for user
2. Sets `last_processed = now - 30 days`
3. Processes all messages from last 30 days
4. Creates summaries for historical conversations

**Subsequent runs:**
1. Finds last summary timestamp
2. Queries for NEW messages only
3. If no new messages: **SKIPS processing** (0 cost!)
4. If new messages: Creates windows for new activity only

### Testing Recommendations

```bash
# 1. Monitor enrichment worker logs
docker compose -p whisperengine-multi -f docker-compose.multi-bot.yml \
  logs -f enrichment-worker | grep "new messages\|Created.*windows"

# Expected output (after initial backfill):
# "No new messages for user X since Y" (most users)
# "Created 1 windows for 10 new messages (user Z)" (active users only)

# 2. Check database for summaries
docker exec postgres psql -U whisperengine -d postgres -c \
  "SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as summaries, 
   MAX(end_timestamp) as last_processed 
   FROM conversation_summaries 
   GROUP BY user_id 
   ORDER BY summaries DESC LIMIT 10;"

# 3. Monitor OpenRouter costs
# Should see dramatic reduction in API calls after first cycle
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **LLM calls/cycle** | 90,000 | ~300 | **300x reduction** |
| **Qdrant queries** | 3,000 | 1,000 | **3x reduction** |
| **Processing time** | ~30 min | ~30 sec | **60x faster** |
| **Daily cost** | $36,300 | $121 | **300x cheaper** |
| **Wasted re-processing** | 99% | 0% | **100% elimination** |

### Real-World Impact

**Scenario: Active Discord community**
- 10 bots with distinct personalities
- 1,000 total users across all bots
- ~100 active users per hour (10% activity rate)
- Average 10 messages/hour per active user

**Cost comparison:**
- **OLD**: $36,300/day (processes everyone every 5 min)
- **NEW**: $121/day (processes only active users)
- **Savings**: **$36,179/day** or **$1,085,370/month** 💰

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Optimizations

1. **Adaptive polling interval**
   - High activity: Check every 5 min
   - Low activity: Check every 30 min
   - Dead hours: Check every hour

2. **Batch processing**
   - Group multiple users' new messages
   - Single LLM call for batch summarization
   - Further 10x cost reduction

3. **Smart window sizing**
   - Short bursts: 1-hour windows
   - Extended conversations: 24-hour windows
   - Multi-day gaps: Separate windows

4. **Priority processing**
   - Active users: Process immediately
   - Inactive users: Defer to off-peak hours
   - Historical backfill: Run once at night
