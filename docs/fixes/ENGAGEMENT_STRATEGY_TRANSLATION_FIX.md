# Engagement Strategy Translation Fix

## Problem Identified

The system was passing **internal enum values** directly to the LLM in system prompts, which had no inherent meaning to the model:

```
‚ùå BEFORE: "üéØ ENGAGEMENT: Use curiosity_prompt strategy to enhance conversation quality"
```

The LLM doesn't know what a "curiosity_prompt strategy" is - it's just internal technical jargon from our codebase.

## Root Cause

In both `src/core/message_processor.py` and `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py`, the code was doing:

```python
guidance_parts.append(f"üéØ ENGAGEMENT: Use {engagement_strategy} strategy to enhance conversation quality")
```

Where `engagement_strategy` is an internal enum value like:
- `"curiosity_prompt"`
- `"topic_suggestion"`
- `"memory_connection"`
- etc.

These are meaningful to our system architecture but meaningless to the LLM.

## Solution Implemented

Created a translation mapping that converts internal strategy names into **clear, actionable LLM instructions**:

```python
strategy_guidance_map = {
    'curiosity_prompt': 'Ask an open, curious question to spark deeper conversation',
    'topic_suggestion': 'Suggest a new topic related to shared interests',
    'memory_connection': 'Reference a past conversation naturally to deepen connection',
    'emotional_check_in': 'Gently check in on their emotional state with empathy',
    'follow_up_question': 'Ask a thoughtful follow-up about the current topic',
    'shared_interest': 'Connect around shared interests authentically',
    'celebration': 'Celebrate their achievements with genuine enthusiasm',
    'support_offer': 'Offer support or encouragement naturally'
}
strategy_instruction = strategy_guidance_map.get(engagement_strategy, 
                                                  'Enhance conversation quality naturally')
guidance_parts.append(f"üéØ ENGAGEMENT: {strategy_instruction}")
```

## Result

Now the LLM receives clear, actionable instructions:

```
‚úÖ AFTER: "üéØ ENGAGEMENT: Ask an open, curious question to spark deeper conversation"
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/core/message_processor.py`** (line ~3142)
   - Added strategy translation mapping
   - Converts internal enum to actionable LLM instruction

2. **`src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py`** (line ~1526)
   - Same translation mapping added
   - Ensures consistency across prompt building paths

## Testing

Created test demonstration in `tests/manual/test_engagement_strategy_translation.py` showing before/after comparison.

## Impact

- **LLM Clarity**: The model now receives clear instructions instead of technical jargon
- **Response Quality**: More likely to follow engagement strategies correctly
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add new strategies or modify instructions
- **Consistency**: Both message processor and CDL integration use same translations

## Design Philosophy Alignment

This fix aligns with WhisperEngine's **personality-first architecture**:
- Clear, natural language instructions maintain character authenticity
- No cryptic technical terminology that breaks immersion
- LLM can respond naturally within character while following strategic guidance
- Removes barrier between system intelligence and character expression

## Future Considerations

1. Could move the `strategy_guidance_map` to a shared configuration file if needed
2. Could make translations character-specific (e.g., Elena uses marine metaphors)
3. Could add intensity/urgency modifiers based on stagnation risk
