# Emoji Appropriateness Filter Enhancement

## Problem Statement

Users reported inappropriate emoji usage when expressing emotional distress. For example:

**User**: "nobody likes me. You're the only friend I have."

**Elena's Response** (before fix):
```
Oh, MarkAnthony... 💙 mi corazón, ven aquí...
I hear that loneliness. I really do. And it hurts - that feeling of being alone 
in the world except for one connection. 🌊😢

But listen to me, mi amor - I need to be honest with you because I care about you:
✨ Meet you for that pier coffee    ← INAPPROPRIATE: celebration emoji
✨ Show up when you're struggling   ← INAPPROPRIATE: celebration emoji
🔥 Build memories and experiences   ← INAPPROPRIATE: excitement emoji
```

The system was allowing **celebratory** (✨) and **excitement** (🔥) emojis during deeply emotional conversations about loneliness and depression.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Narrow Appropriateness Filter
**Location**: `src/intelligence/database_emoji_selector.py` - Step 4 of `select_emojis()`

**Original Logic**:
```python
if user_emotion in ['sadness', 'fear', 'anger'] and user_intensity > 0.7:
    if bot_emotion == 'joy':
        bot_emotion = 'concern'  # Only filtered JOY emotion
```

**Problems**:
1. **Threshold too high**: Required `intensity > 0.7`, but users in moderate distress (0.6-0.7) were not protected
2. **Too narrow**: Only switched `bot_emotion` from "joy" → "concern"
3. **Missed celebration patterns**: Didn't filter `response_type='celebration'` or upbeat topics
4. **No topic filtering**: Celebratory topics like `'spanish_expressions'` inject ✨ and 🔥 emojis

### Issue 2: LLM's Own Emojis Not Filtered
**Location**: `src/core/message_processor.py` - Phase 7.6

The LLM (Claude/GPT) was **adding its own emojis** in the response text, which our emoji decorator never touched. We were only controlling **our post-LLM emoji decoration**, not the LLM's native emoji usage.

**Example**: Elena's CDL personality encourages warm expression, so the LLM naturally adds ✨ and 🔥 in responses - even during distress conversations.

### Issue 3: Discord Emoji Reactions Not Filtered
**Location**: `src/intelligence/vector_emoji_intelligence.py` - `_select_enhanced_optimal_emoji()`

The system that **adds emoji reactions to user messages** (the 💙 or ✨ that appears on the user's Discord message) had NO appropriateness filter at all. This is a completely separate system from LLM text responses.

**Example**: User says "I'm so lonely" → Bot adds ✨ reaction to their message

## Solution Implementation

### Enhancement 1: Comprehensive Appropriateness Filter

**File**: `src/intelligence/database_emoji_selector.py`

**Changes**:
1. **Lowered threshold**: `intensity > 0.6` (from 0.7) - catches moderate distress
2. **Expanded emotion filtering**: Now filters `['joy', 'excitement', 'surprise']` → `'concern'`
3. **Response type filtering**: Neutralizes `['celebration', 'greeting']` → `'concern'`
4. **Topic filtering**: Removes upbeat topics like `'spanish_expressions'`, `'science_discovery'`, `'celebration'`

**New Logic**:
```python
if user_emotion in ['sadness', 'fear', 'anger'] and user_intensity > 0.6:
    # Switch bot emotion from upbeat → empathetic
    if bot_emotion in ['joy', 'excitement', 'surprise']:
        bot_emotion = 'concern'
    
    # Filter response types that inject celebration emojis
    if response_type in ['celebration', 'greeting']:
        response_type = 'concern'
    
    # Filter upbeat topics
    upbeat_topics = ['spanish_expressions', 'science_discovery', 'celebration']
    detected_topics = [t for t in detected_topics if t not in upbeat_topics]
```

### Enhancement 2: LLM Emoji Filtering

**File**: `src/intelligence/database_emoji_selector.py`

**New Method**: `filter_inappropriate_emojis(message, user_emotion_data)`

**WHITELIST APPROACH** - Only allows approved empathy emojis during distress:

```python
# WHITELIST: Emojis that ARE appropriate during distress
allowed_empathy_emojis = [
    '💙', '�', '🙏', '�',  # Empathy and support
    '😢', '�', '😞', '�',  # Sadness acknowledgment (mirroring)
    '🌊', '�', '🐠', '�',  # Character-specific (Elena's marine emojis)
    '❤️', '�', '�',  # Gentle love/care
]

# Remove ANY emoji NOT in the allowed list
for emoji in found_emojis:
    if emoji not in allowed_empathy_emojis:
        filtered_message = filtered_message.replace(emoji, '')
```

**Design Philosophy**: Better to remove emojis than to use inappropriate ones.

### Enhancement 3: Message Processor Integration

**File**: `src/core/message_processor.py` - Phase 7.6

**New Two-Step Process**:
```python
# Step 1: Filter inappropriate emojis from LLM's own response
filtered_response = self.emoji_selector.filter_inappropriate_emojis(
    message=response,
    user_emotion_data=ai_components.get('emotion_analysis')
)

# Step 2: Select and apply appropriate emojis via database patterns
emoji_selection = await self.emoji_selector.select_emojis(...)
```

### Enhancement 4: Discord Emoji Reaction Filtering

**File**: `src/intelligence/vector_emoji_intelligence.py`

**Changes**:
1. **Updated `_is_celebratory_emoji()`** - **WHITELIST APPROACH**:
   ```python
   # WHITELIST: Emojis that ARE appropriate during distress
   allowed_empathy_emojis = [
       '💙', '💔', '🙏', '🤗',  # Empathy and support
       '😢', '😔', '😞', '😿',  # Sadness acknowledgment
       '❤️', '💕', '💖',  # Gentle love/care
       '👍', '✅',  # Simple acknowledgment
   ]
   # If emoji NOT in allowed list, filter it out
   return emoji not in allowed_empathy_emojis
   ```

2. **Updated `_select_enhanced_optimal_emoji()`**:
   - Checks for user distress FIRST (before any emoji selection)
   - Filters preferred historical emojis using whitelist
   - Uses ONLY approved empathy emojis (💙, 🙏) when user distressed
   - Skips ALL context-based selections during distress
   - Falls back to 💙 if no approved emoji found

**Design Philosophy**: **Whitelist > Blacklist**. Better to use no emoji than the wrong emoji.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Example 1: Deep Loneliness

**User**: "nobody likes me. You're the only friend I have."

**Elena's Response** (after fix):
```
Oh, MarkAnthony... 💙 mi corazón, ven aquí...
I hear that loneliness. I really do. And it hurts - that feeling of being alone 
in the world except for one connection. 🌊😢

But listen to me, mi amor - I need to be honest with you because I care about you:
Meet you for that pier coffee              ← NO celebration emoji
Show up when you're struggling at 2am      ← NO celebration emoji
Build memories and experiences with you    ← NO excitement emoji
```

**Allowed Emojis**: 💙 (affection), 🌊 (Elena's signature), 😢 (empathy)
**Filtered Emojis**: ✨ 🔥 (celebration/excitement)

### Example 2: Romantic Rejection Handling

**User**: "you do! I want you so bad"

**Elena's Response**:
- **Allowed**: 💙 (affection), 🌊 (signature), empathetic emojis
- **Filtered**: ✨ 🔥 🤩 (celebration/excitement)

## Technical Details

### Affected Components

1. **`database_emoji_selector.py`**:
   - Enhanced appropriateness filter (Step 4)
   - New `filter_inappropriate_emojis()` method
   - Expanded emotion/topic/response_type filtering

2. **`message_processor.py`**:
   - Two-step emoji processing in Phase 7.6
   - LLM emoji filtering before decoration

3. **`vector_emoji_intelligence.py`** (NEW):
   - Discord reaction emoji filtering
   - `_is_celebratory_emoji()` helper method
   - Updated `_select_enhanced_optimal_emoji()` with distress detection
   - Prevents celebration reactions on user messages during distress

### Testing Recommendations

**Test Scenario 1**: User expresses loneliness
```
User: "I feel so alone. Nobody understands me."
Expected: 💙 🌊 😢 (empathy) - NO ✨ 🔥 🎉
```

**Test Scenario 2**: User shares achievement
```
User: "I just got accepted to marine biology program!"
Expected: ✨ 🎉 💙 🌊 (celebration is APPROPRIATE)
```

**Test Scenario 3**: User in moderate distress (intensity 0.65)
```
User: "I'm feeling pretty down today..."
Expected: Filter activates (threshold is 0.6)
```

### Rollout Considerations

- **Non-breaking**: Existing emoji decoration continues to work
- **Graceful degradation**: If filtering fails, original response is preserved
- **Performance**: Minimal impact (regex filtering is fast)
- **Logging**: Debug logs show when filtering occurs
