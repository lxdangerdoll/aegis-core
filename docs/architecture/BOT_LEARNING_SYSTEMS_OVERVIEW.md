# Bot Learning Systems - Complete Overview

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Production - Multiple Systems Working Together  
**Purpose**: Clarify how WhisperEngine's bot learning systems work (they're complementary, not redundant)

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

WhisperEngine has **TWO complementary bot learning systems**:

1. **Character Episodic Intelligence** (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED & ACTIVE)
   - Analyzes emotional patterns across conversations
   - Identifies memorable moments with high RoBERTa confidence
   - Injected into prompts as reflective memories
   
2. **Bot Self-Fact Extraction** (üéØ DESIGNED, NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
   - Extracts specific declarative statements bots make
   - Stores persistent facts in PostgreSQL
   - Ensures consistency of stated preferences

**They are NOT redundant** - they serve different purposes and work together.

## System 1: Character Episodic Intelligence ‚úÖ

### What It Does

Analyzes **emotional patterns** in bot responses to identify memorable moments worth referencing later.

### Implementation Status: ‚úÖ ACTIVE IN PRODUCTION

**Location**: `src/characters/learning/character_vector_episodic_intelligence.py`

**Integration Point**: `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py` (lines 1949-1991)

**Prompt Injection**: `src/characters/cdl/character_graph_manager.py` (line 1373)

### How It Works

1. **Analyzes RoBERTa Emotion Data** from existing Qdrant vector conversations
2. **Filters Memorable Moments**:
   - RoBERTa confidence > 0.8
   - Emotional intensity > 0.7
   - Multi-emotion moments get priority
3. **Extracts Top 2 Memories** per conversation
4. **Injects into System Prompt** as reflective context

### User-Facing Impact

**System Prompt Injection** (what bot sees):
```
‚ú® CHARACTER EPISODIC MEMORIES (for natural reflection):
You remember these emotionally significant moments from past conversations:
1. Joy moment: "I absolutely love exploring tidal pools at dawn..."
   (Emotional significance: 0.8/1.0, Confidence: 0.9/1.0)
2. Fascination moment: "The bioluminescence patterns in deep sea creatures..."
   (Emotional significance: 0.7/1.0, Confidence: 0.85/1.0)

You may naturally reference these memories if relevant to the current conversation.
```

**Bot Response** (what user sees):
```
User: "Have you been thinking about anything interesting lately?"
Bot: "Actually, yes! I've been reflecting on our conversation about tidal pools. 
     There's something magical about those early morning explorations..."
```

### What It Captures

‚úÖ **Emotional patterns**: "I tend to get excited about marine topics"  
‚úÖ **Memorable moments**: "That conversation about bioluminescence was fascinating"  
‚úÖ **Topic enthusiasm**: "I always light up when discussing deep sea creatures"  
‚úÖ **Personality traits**: "I'm naturally drawn to complex ecosystems"

### What It DOESN'T Capture

‚ùå **Specific stated facts**: "I prefer Earl Grey tea"  
‚ùå **Declarative preferences**: "I love hiking on weekends"  
‚ùå **One-time statements**: "My favorite color is blue"  
‚ùå **Persistent characteristics**: "I own a telescope"

### Storage

- **Ephemeral** (computed on-demand from Qdrant vectors)
- No separate PostgreSQL storage needed
- Analyzes existing RoBERTa emotion metadata
- Zero additional storage cost

### Performance

- **Query time**: ~50-100ms (Qdrant scroll + filtering)
- **LLM cost**: Zero (no additional LLM calls)
- **Storage**: Zero (uses existing vector data)

## System 2: Bot Self-Fact Extraction üéØ

### What It Does

Extracts **specific declarative statements** bots make and stores them persistently for consistency.

### Implementation Status: üéØ DESIGNED, NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Design Docs**:
- `docs/features/BOT_SELF_FACT_EXTRACTION.md`
- `docs/features/BOT_SELF_FACT_DESIGN_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `docs/features/BOT_SELF_FACT_PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Planned Integration**: `src/enrichment/fact_extraction_engine.py`

### How It Would Work

1. **Enrichment Worker** scans bot responses in conversation windows
2. **LLM Extracts Facts** from "I/my/mine" declarative statements
3. **Priority Filtering**: Only HIGH/MEDIUM priority facts (3-5 per window)
4. **Stores in PostgreSQL**: `user_id="myself"`, `mentioned_by_character="elena"`
5. **Injects into Prompts**: "You previously mentioned you prefer Earl Grey tea"

### User-Facing Impact

**System Prompt Injection** (what bot would see):
```
üìù YOUR ESTABLISHED PREFERENCES (for consistency):
- You prefer Earl Grey tea over coffee
- You love exploring tidal pools on weekends
- You find crustacean behavior fascinating
- Your morning routine includes reviewing marine research
```

**Bot Response** (what user would see):
```
User: "Want to grab coffee?"
Bot: "I appreciate the offer, but I'm more of a tea person! Earl Grey is my go-to.
     Perhaps we could meet at a caf√© that serves good tea?"
```

### What It Would Capture

‚úÖ **Specific preferences**: "I prefer Earl Grey tea"  
‚úÖ **Stated habits**: "Every morning I review research papers"  
‚úÖ **Declared passions**: "I love exploring tidal pools"  
‚úÖ **Persistent facts**: "I own a telescope"

### What It Would NOT Capture

‚ùå **Emotional patterns**: "I tend to get excited about X"  
‚ùå **Behavioral trends**: "I often discuss marine topics"  
‚ùå **Temporary states**: "I'm tired right now"  
‚ùå **Generic ownership**: "I have a laptop"

### Storage

- **Persistent** (PostgreSQL `user_fact_relationships` table)
- Uses "myself" convention: `user_id="myself"`
- Bot isolation via `mentioned_by_character` field
- Same tables as user facts (unified schema)

### Priority Filtering (Critical Design Element)

**HIGH Priority** (‚úÖ Always extract):
- "I **love** X", "I **prefer** Y over Z"
- "**My passion** is X", "I'm **fascinated by** X"
- "I **always** X", "Every morning I X"

**MEDIUM Priority** (‚úÖ Extract if clear):
- "I enjoy X", "I like Y"
- "I often X", "I tend to X"

**LOW Priority** (‚ùå Skip):
- "I'm tired" (temporary)
- "I have a laptop" (generic)
- "I like this conversation" (politeness)

**Limits**:
- 3-5 facts per 24-hour window
- 10-20 total facts per bot
- Alert if exceeds 50 facts

## Why BOTH Systems Are Valuable

### They Solve Different Problems

| Aspect | Episodic Intelligence | Bot Self-Facts |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Pattern recognition | Statement consistency |
| **Example** | "I notice I get excited about marine topics" | "I prefer Earl Grey tea" |
| **Data Source** | Analyzes emotion patterns | Extracts declarative statements |
| **Storage** | Ephemeral (computed) | Persistent (PostgreSQL) |
| **Scope** | "I tend to..." | "I said..." |
| **Timeline** | Behavioral patterns | Specific moments |
| **Use Case** | Self-awareness of patterns | Maintaining stated preferences |

### Real-World Analogy

**Person reflecting on behavior**:
- Episodic Intelligence: "I notice I smile whenever someone mentions dogs" (pattern)
- Bot Self-Facts: "My favorite dog breed is Golden Retriever" (stated fact)

**Both are valuable!** Humans do both:
- We recognize our own behavioral patterns
- We remember specific things we've said

### Complementary, Not Redundant

**Scenario: Elena discusses ocean exploration**

**Episodic Intelligence captures**:
- "Elena shows high enthusiasm (0.85 intensity) when discussing ocean topics"
- "Pattern detected across 5 conversations over 2 weeks"
- Bot response: "I've been reflecting on how much I love ocean conversations..."

**Bot Self-Facts would capture**:
- "Elena stated: 'I love exploring tidal pools at dawn'"
- "Elena stated: 'My favorite research area is bioluminescence'"
- Bot response: "As I mentioned before, I love exploring tidal pools..."

**Together they create**:
- Rich self-awareness (episodic patterns)
- Specific preference consistency (stated facts)
- Natural, authentic personality

## Technical Details

### Episodic Intelligence Query
```python
episodic_memories = await graph_manager.extract_episodic_memories(
    character_name="elena",
    limit=2,                    # Just a few memorable moments
    min_confidence=0.7,         # High confidence memories
    min_intensity=0.6           # Emotionally significant
)
```

### Bot Self-Facts Query (Future)
```sql
-- Get Elena's self-facts
SELECT fe.entity_name, ufr.relationship_type, ufr.confidence
FROM user_fact_relationships ufr
JOIN fact_entities fe ON ufr.entity_id = fe.id
WHERE ufr.user_id = 'myself' 
  AND ufr.mentioned_by_character = 'elena'
  AND ufr.confidence >= 0.75
ORDER BY ufr.confidence DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Monitoring Queries

### Check Episodic Intelligence Activity
```bash
# Check logs for episodic memory injection
docker logs <bot-container> 2>&1 | grep "EPISODIC INTELLIGENCE"
```

### Check Bot Self-Facts (Future)
```sql
-- Count facts per bot
SELECT 
    mentioned_by_character as bot_name,
    COUNT(*) as fact_count,
    AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM user_fact_relationships
WHERE user_id = 'myself'
GROUP BY mentioned_by_character
ORDER BY fact_count DESC;
```

## Conclusion

WhisperEngine's bot learning is **multi-layered**:

1. **CDL Database** (static) ‚Üí Baseline personality definition
2. **Character Episodic Intelligence** (dynamic patterns) ‚Üí Self-awareness
3. **Bot Self-Fact Extraction** (dynamic facts) ‚Üí Statement consistency

All three work together to create the most authentic, consistent AI personalities in production.

**No redundancy. No conflict. Just complementary systems creating personality fidelity.** ‚ú®
