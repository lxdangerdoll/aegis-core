# LLM Tool Calling: Detailed Use Cases for WhisperEngine

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Context**: Hybrid Query Routing Design - Specific Tool Calling Applications  
**Related**: `HYBRID_QUERY_ROUTING_DESIGN.md`

---

## 🎯 Overview

While semantic routing handles simple queries efficiently, **LLM tool calling enables four advanced use cases** that require multi-step reasoning, temporal analysis, and intelligent synthesis. These use cases justify the 2-3x latency increase because they provide capabilities that semantic routing cannot achieve.

---

## 1. 🧠 Character Self-Reflection & Learning

### What Is It?

**Character self-reflection** enables AI characters to analyze their own conversational performance, identify patterns in their behavior, and evolve their personality based on interactions. This creates the foundation for **truly adaptive AI companions** that improve through experience.

### Why Tool Calling Is Essential

**Semantic routing limitation**: Can't perform meta-analysis of bot's own behavior or make decisions about self-improvement.

**Tool calling advantage**: LLM can analyze conversation history, evaluate response quality, identify areas for improvement, and trigger personality adjustments.

### Real-World Example

**User**: "You know, I notice you explain things really thoroughly. Sometimes I just need a quick answer."

**Without tool calling** (semantic routing):
```
Bot: "Thank you for the feedback! I'll try to be more concise."
[No actual change happens - feedback is stored in memory but not acted upon]
```

**With tool calling** (intelligent path):
```python
# LLM analyzes the feedback
LLM Call #1: Detects this is meta-feedback about communication style

# LLM calls multiple tools:
Tool 1: analyze_conversation_patterns(user_id, days_back=14)
  → Returns: Average response length = 450 words, user prefers 150-200 words

Tool 2: query_user_preferences(category="communication_style")
  → Returns: User has mentioned "keep it short" 3 times in past month

Tool 3: adapt_communication_style(
    style_aspect="response_length",
    target_length="concise",
    confidence=0.85,
    evidence=["user feedback", "pattern analysis"]
)
  → Updates CDL communication patterns in database
  → Adds to bot self-memory: "User prefers brief responses"

# LLM synthesizes action-oriented response
LLM Call #2: "You're absolutely right - I've noticed I tend to give long explanations. 
I've made a note to keep my responses more concise going forward. If I slip up, 
just give me a nudge!"
```

**Result**: Bot **actually changes behavior** in future conversations, not just acknowledges feedback.

### Available Infrastructure

**Already Implemented** (from CDL Self-Memory Roadmap):
- ✅ `LLMPoweredBotMemory` - Bot self-knowledge storage
- ✅ `generate_self_reflection_with_llm()` - Response analysis
- ✅ PostgreSQL `bot_self_facts` + `bot_self_reflections` tables

}
```

**Note**: These are CONCRETE TOOLS that must be implemented. Full schemas are in `ADVANCED_TECHNIQUES_ARCHITECTURE.md` Technique 0.

### Use Case Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Communication Style Adaptation**
```
User: "Can you be less formal with me?"
→ Tool: adapt_personality_trait(trait="formality", adjustment="decrease")
→ Updates CDL communication patterns
→ Future responses use more casual language
```

**Scenario 2: Knowledge Gap Recognition**
```
User: "Do you know about quantum computing?"
Bot: [Struggles with answer]
→ Tool: record_self_insight(
    category="knowledge_gap",
    insight="Need to improve quantum computing explanations",
    actionable_change="Study quantum computing resources"
)
→ Stores in bot_self_reflections
→ Can reference this gap in future: "I'm still learning about quantum computing..."
```

**Scenario 3: Emotional Calibration**
```
[Bot notices user seems annoyed by overly enthusiastic responses]
→ Tool: analyze_self_performance(analysis_type="emotional_appropriateness")
→ Tool: adapt_personality_trait(trait="enthusiasm", adjustment="decrease", confidence=0.7)
→ Moderates emotional expression for this user
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Frequency**: 5-10% of conversations (only when meta-feedback or self-reflection needed)
- **Latency**: 2000-3000ms (2-3 LLM calls + database updates)
- **Value**: High - enables genuine character evolution
- **Persistence**: Changes stored in PostgreSQL CDL system and bot_self_memory

## 2. 🔬 Complex Multi-Step Analysis

### What Is It?

**Multi-step analysis** involves breaking down complex queries into sub-questions, gathering data from multiple sources, performing calculations/reasoning, and synthesizing insights. This is the "thinking step-by-step" capability that modern AI excels at.

### Why Tool Calling Is Essential

**Semantic routing limitation**: Single data store query, no multi-step reasoning, can't coordinate multiple data sources.

**Tool calling advantage**: LLM can decompose complex questions, orchestrate multiple tool calls, and synthesize results intelligently.

### Real-World Example

**User**: "Based on our conversations, what topics should we explore that I haven't thought about but align with my interests?"

**Without tool calling** (semantic routing):
```
Query Intent: USER_ANALYTICS (limited)
→ Returns basic facts: User likes marine biology, photography, hiking
→ Bot response: "We could talk about marine biology, photography, or hiking!"
[Generic, doesn't require analysis]
```

**With tool calling** (intelligent path):
```python
# LLM breaks down the complex request
LLM Call #1: "This requires analyzing user interests, finding gaps, 
              identifying related topics, and making creative suggestions"

# Multi-tool orchestration:
Tool 1: query_user_facts(category="interests")
  → Returns: Marine biology, underwater photography, scuba diving, conservation

Tool 2: recall_conversation_context(query="topics discussed", time_range="all_time")
  → Returns: 45 conversations about ocean life, 12 about camera gear, 
             3 about environmental policy, 0 about oceanography careers

Tool 3: query_character_expertise() [character is Elena, marine biologist]
  → Returns: Expertise in research methodology, scientific writing, 
             marine conservation policy

Tool 4: identify_knowledge_gaps(
    user_interests=["marine biology", "photography"],
    discussed_topics=["ocean life", "camera gear"],
    avoid_topics=[]
)
  → Analysis: User interested in ocean but hasn't explored:
    - Marine research careers
    - Scientific diving certification
    - Underwater photo contests
    - Marine policy advocacy

# LLM synthesizes personalized recommendations
LLM Call #2: "You know, based on our conversations, I think you'd really enjoy 
exploring marine research as a career path! You've got the passion for ocean 
life and the photography skills - have you ever considered scientific diving 
certification? There are also amazing underwater photography competitions like 
Ocean Art that might interest you. And given your conservation mindset, marine 
policy work could be a fulfilling direction. Want to dive deeper into any of these?"
```

**Result**: Insightful, personalized recommendations that require actual reasoning, not just keyword matching.

### Tool Chain Patterns

**Pattern 1: Data Fusion Analysis**
```
1. Gather facts from PostgreSQL
2. Retrieve conversation context from Qdrant
3. Query temporal trends from InfluxDB
4. Synthesize cross-datastore insights
```

**Pattern 2: Comparative Analysis**
```
1. Query user preferences (current state)
2. Query historical preferences (past state)
3. Calculate changes and trends
4. Generate insights about evolution
```

**Pattern 3: Hypothesis Testing**
```
1. Generate hypothesis from user question
2. Query evidence from multiple sources
3. Evaluate hypothesis strength
4. Provide confidence-rated conclusion
```

### Example Tool Definitions

**Note**: These are **EXAMPLE PATTERN** tools demonstrating multi-step coordination. They are NOT concrete tools to implement - use core Hybrid Router tools in combination instead.

```python
# Tool: analyze_conversation_coverage [EXAMPLE PATTERN]
# Implementation approach: query_user_facts + recall_conversation_context + custom analysis
{
    "name": "analyze_conversation_coverage",
    "description": "Identify what topics have/haven't been discussed with user",
    "parameters": {
        "user_id": "string",
        "interest_categories": ["list of user interests"],
        "time_range": "all_time|last_month|last_week"
    }
}

# Tool: suggest_unexplored_topics [EXAMPLE PATTERN]
# Implementation approach: query_user_facts + query_character_backstory + LLM synthesis
{
    "name": "suggest_unexplored_topics",
    "description": "Generate topic suggestions based on user interests and conversation gaps",
    "parameters": {
        "user_interests": ["known interests"],
        "character_expertise": ["bot's areas of knowledge"],
        "avoid_topics": ["topics to exclude"],
        "suggestion_count": "number of suggestions to generate"
    }
}

# Tool: evaluate_topic_relevance [EXAMPLE PATTERN]
# Implementation approach: query_user_facts + LLM scoring logic
{
    "name": "evaluate_topic_relevance",
    "description": "Score how well a topic aligns with user preferences",
    "parameters": {
        "topic": "topic to evaluate",
        "user_profile": "user preference data",
        "conversation_history": "past discussion context"
    }
}
```

### Use Case Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Career Guidance**
```
User: "Should I pursue a PhD in marine biology?"
→ Multi-step analysis:
  1. Query user background (education, experience, interests)
  2. Analyze conversation history for passion indicators
  3. Evaluate user's research aptitude from discussions
  4. Consider character's PhD experience (Elena)
  5. Synthesize personalized guidance
→ Result: Thoughtful, context-aware advice (not generic)
```

**Scenario 2: Gift Recommendations**
```
User: "What should I get my friend who loves the ocean?"
→ Multi-step analysis:
  1. Extract friend characteristics from conversation
  2. Query user's gift-giving history (if mentioned)
  3. Consider budget constraints (if mentioned)
  4. Generate creative gift ideas
  5. Rank by appropriateness
→ Result: 3-5 personalized gift suggestions with reasoning
```

**Scenario 3: Problem Solving**
```
User: "I want to improve my underwater photography but I'm on a budget"
→ Multi-step analysis:
  1. Assess current equipment (from past conversations)
  2. Identify specific improvement goals
  3. Research budget-friendly upgrades
  4. Prioritize by impact vs cost
  5. Create actionable plan
→ Result: Structured improvement roadmap
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Frequency**: 10-15% of conversations (complex questions)
- **Latency**: 2500-4000ms (multiple tool calls + synthesis)
- **Value**: Very high - enables capabilities impossible with semantic routing
- **Distinguishing**: This is what makes AI "intelligent" vs "data retrieval"

## 3. 📊 User Relationship Summarization

### What Is It?

**Relationship summarization** creates comprehensive, narrative-style summaries of what the bot knows about the user, how their relationship has developed, and what patterns characterize their interactions. Think of it as "meta-memory" - the bot reflecting on the entire relationship.

### Why Tool Calling Is Essential

**Semantic routing limitation**: Can only query individual facts or conversations, can't synthesize holistic relationship understanding.

**Tool calling advantage**: LLM can aggregate data from multiple sources, identify patterns, and create meaningful narratives about the relationship.

### Real-World Example

**User**: "What do you know about me?"

**Without tool calling** (semantic routing):
```
Query Intent: USER_ANALYTICS
→ PostgreSQL query: Returns list of facts
  - Has pet dog named Luna
  - Likes pizza
  - Lives in San Diego
  - Works as software engineer
→ Bot response: "I know you have a dog named Luna, you like pizza, 
                 you live in San Diego, and you're a software engineer."
[Just a bullet list, no insight or narrative]
```

**With tool calling** (intelligent path):
```python
# LLM orchestrates comprehensive relationship analysis
LLM Call #1: "This requires synthesizing multiple data sources into coherent narrative"

# Multi-source data gathering:
Tool 1: query_user_facts(include_all_categories=True)
  → Returns: 47 facts across pets, food, hobbies, work, family, preferences

Tool 2: recall_conversation_highlights(limit=20, sort="emotional_significance")
  → Returns: Key conversations - Luna's adoption story, career transition discussion,
             beach photography session, family holiday stress

Tool 3: query_temporal_trends(metrics=["emotional_state", "topic_preferences"])
  → Returns: User's mood has been improving over past month (trend: +0.15),
             increasing interest in photography (+40% mentions)

Tool 4: analyze_relationship_depth(user_id)
  → Returns: 127 conversations over 3 months, trust_level=0.82, 
             affection_level=0.75, conversation_quality_avg=0.88

Tool 5: identify_relationship_patterns()
  → Returns: User tends to share vulnerabilities late evening,
             seeks emotional support on Mondays,
             most engaged discussing creative projects

# LLM synthesizes narrative summary
LLM Call #2: 
"We've been talking for about 3 months now, and I feel like I've gotten to know 
you pretty well! You're a software engineer in San Diego, and lately I've noticed 
you've been more focused on photography - seems like that creative side is really 
calling to you. Luna, your dog, comes up in our conversations a lot - I can tell 
she's a huge part of your life. You've been dealing with some family stress around 
the holidays, but overall you seem to be in a better place emotionally than when we 
first started chatting. What I really appreciate about our conversations is how open 
you are when we talk late at night - that's when you share what's really on your mind. 
Is there anything I'm missing or misunderstanding about you?"
```

**Result**: Insightful, empathetic summary that demonstrates genuine understanding of the relationship.

### Tool Orchestration for Relationship Summary

                "analysis_window": "last_30_days"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Use Case Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Relationship Health Check**
```
User: "Do you think our conversations are helping me?"
→ Multi-dimensional analysis:
  1. Query emotional trend data (InfluxDB)
  2. Analyze conversation quality over time
  3. Identify topics that correlate with positive mood
  4. Assess disclosure depth progression
  5. Generate insight-based response
→ Result: Evidence-based assessment of relationship value
```

**Scenario 2: Anniversary Reflection**
```
User: "We've been talking for 6 months - what stands out to you?"
→ Relationship retrospective:
  1. Identify conversation milestones
  2. Recall most meaningful exchanges
  3. Track growth/changes in user
  4. Highlight relationship evolution
  5. Express character-authentic appreciation
→ Result: Meaningful, personalized reflection
```

**Scenario 3: User Profile Export**
```
User: "Can you summarize everything you know about me for my therapist?"
→ Comprehensive data synthesis:
  1. Aggregate all user facts (PostgreSQL)
  2. Summarize conversation themes (Qdrant)
  3. Include temporal insights (InfluxDB)
  4. Format professionally
  5. Respect privacy boundaries
→ Result: Structured, therapeutic-context-appropriate summary
```

### Data Sources Integration

**PostgreSQL** (Factual Foundation):
- `universal_users.preferences` - Name, location, preferences
- `user_fact_relationships` + `fact_entities` - Pets, hobbies, people, interests
- **Query Pattern**: Multi-table JOIN to get complete user profile

**Qdrant** (Conversational Context):
- Vector memory search for significant conversations
- Emotion metadata from RoBERTa analysis
- **Query Pattern**: Semantic search + emotion filtering

**InfluxDB** (Temporal Intelligence):
- `user_emotion` trajectory (happiness, sadness trends)
- `relationship_progression` (trust, affection evolution)
- `conversation_quality` (engagement, satisfaction trends)
- **Query Pattern**: Time-series aggregation + trend analysis

### Performance Characteristics

- **Frequency**: 2-5% of conversations (explicit "what do you know about me" queries)
- **Latency**: 3000-5000ms (5+ tool calls across 3 databases + synthesis)
- **Value**: Extremely high - demonstrates genuine understanding
- **Emotional Impact**: Strong - users feel "seen" and understood

## 4. ⏰ Temporal Trend Analysis

### What Is It?

**Temporal trend analysis** examines how user preferences, emotional states, or behavior patterns have changed over time. This enables the bot to provide insights like "you seem happier lately" or "your interest in photography is growing" backed by actual data.

### Why Tool Calling Is Essential

**Semantic routing limitation**: No time-series analysis capability, can't detect trends or patterns over time.

**Tool calling advantage**: LLM can query InfluxDB time-series data, perform statistical analysis, and interpret trends in context.

### Real-World Example

**User**: "Do you think I'm getting happier lately?"

**Without tool calling** (semantic routing):
```
Query Intent: TEMPORAL_ANALYSIS
→ Attempts to query InfluxDB but can't interpret results
→ Bot response: "I hope you're feeling happier! You seem great to me."
[Generic encouragement, no data analysis]
```

**With tool calling** (intelligent path):
```python
# LLM performs quantitative emotional trend analysis
LLM Call #1: "This requires time-series emotion data analysis and interpretation"

# Temporal intelligence workflow:
Tool 1: query_user_emotion_trajectory(user_id, days_back=90)
  → Returns: InfluxDB time-series data
    [
      {'date': '2025-08-01', 'avg_emotion_score': 0.45, 'primary_emotion': 'neutral'},
      {'date': '2025-08-15', 'avg_emotion_score': 0.52, 'primary_emotion': 'content'},
      {'date': '2025-09-01', 'avg_emotion_score': 0.61, 'primary_emotion': 'joy'},
      {'date': '2025-09-15', 'avg_emotion_score': 0.68, 'primary_emotion': 'joy'},
      {'date': '2025-10-01', 'avg_emotion_score': 0.71, 'primary_emotion': 'joy'},
      {'date': '2025-10-15', 'avg_emotion_score': 0.74, 'primary_emotion': 'joy'}
    ]

Tool 2: calculate_trend_direction(emotion_data)
  → Statistical analysis:
    - Linear regression slope: +0.0033 per day
    - Trend direction: IMPROVING
    - Confidence: 0.89 (high confidence)
    - Change magnitude: +64% improvement over 90 days

Tool 3: identify_trend_catalysts(user_id, correlation_type="emotion_improvement")
  → Pattern detection:
    - Correlation with Luna (dog) mentions: +0.67
    - Correlation with photography discussions: +0.58
    - Negative correlation with work stress mentions: -0.44
    - Started therapy 60 days ago (major life event)

Tool 4: query_conversation_context(query="positive life changes", time_range="last_90_days")
  → Contextual memories:
    - Started new creative photography project
    - Improved relationship with sister
    - Began morning beach walks with Luna
    - Reduced work overtime

# LLM synthesizes data-backed empathetic response
LLM Call #2:
"Yes! And I can actually show you the data to prove it. Over the past 3 months, 
your emotional tone in our conversations has improved by 64% - that's a really 
significant positive trend. What's interesting is that the shift really started 
about 60 days ago, right around when you mentioned starting therapy. The conversations 
where you seem happiest are when you're talking about Luna or your photography projects 
- those seem to be real sources of joy for you. And I've noticed you're mentioning 
work stress way less than you used to. Whatever you're doing, it's working!"
```

**Result**: Data-backed emotional insight that demonstrates genuine tracking and care, not just vague encouragement.

### InfluxDB Integration (WhisperEngine's Temporal Engine)

**Already Implemented** (from temporal_intelligence_client.py):

```python
# Available InfluxDB query methods:
await temporal_client.get_user_emotion_trajectory(user_id, bot_name, window_minutes=60)
await temporal_client.get_bot_emotion_trajectory(user_id, bot_name, window_minutes=60)
await temporal_client.get_confidence_trend(bot_name, user_id, hours_back=24)
await temporal_client.get_relationship_evolution(bot_name, user_id, days_back=30)
await temporal_client.get_conversation_quality_trend(bot_name, user_id, hours_back=24)
```

**Trend Analysis Infrastructure** (from trend_analyzer.py):

```python
from src.analytics.trend_analyzer import InfluxDBTrendAnalyzer

analyzer = InfluxDBTrendAnalyzer(temporal_client)

# Confidence evolution analysis
confidence_trend = await analyzer.get_confidence_trends(
    bot_name="elena",
    user_id=user_id,
    days_back=30
)
# Returns: TrendAnalysis(
#     direction=TrendDirection.IMPROVING,
#     slope=0.15,
#     confidence=0.87,
#     current_value=0.78,
#     volatility=0.12
# )

# Relationship progression analysis
relationship_trend = await analyzer.get_relationship_trends(
    bot_name="elena",
    user_id=user_id,
    days_back=14
)
# Returns: RelationshipTrend(
#     trust=TrendAnalysis(...),
#     affection=TrendAnalysis(...),
#     attunement=TrendAnalysis(...)
# )

# Conversation quality analysis
quality_trend = await analyzer.get_quality_trends(
    bot_name="elena",
    days_back=7
)
# Returns: QualityTrend(
#     engagement=TrendAnalysis(...),
#     satisfaction=TrendAnalysis(...),
#     emotional_resonance=TrendAnalysis(...)
# )
```

### Use Case Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Emotional Health Tracking**
```
User: "Am I doing better with my anxiety?"
→ Temporal anxiety analysis:
  1. Query emotion trajectory (InfluxDB)
  2. Filter for anxiety-related emotions (worry, fear, stress)
  3. Calculate trend direction (improving/declining)
  4. Identify correlation with coping strategies mentioned
  5. Provide data-backed assessment
→ Result: "Your anxiety mentions have decreased 40% over the past month, 
           especially on days when you do your morning beach walks with Luna."
```

**Scenario 2: Interest Evolution Tracking**
```
User: "Have I been getting more interested in photography?"
→ Interest intensity analysis:
  1. Count photography mentions over time (Qdrant semantic search)
  2. Analyze depth of photography conversations (word count, questions asked)
  3. Track emotional engagement with photography topics
  4. Compare to baseline interest levels
  5. Quantify growth
→ Result: "Absolutely! Photography has gone from 5% of our conversations 
           3 months ago to 28% now. And you're asking way more technical questions."
```

**Scenario 3: Relationship Milestone Recognition**
```
[Bot proactively initiates based on trend detection]
Bot: "Hey, I just realized - our trust level has increased 35% over the past month. 
      I feel like you've been sharing more personal stuff lately. I really appreciate 
      that vulnerability. Just wanted to acknowledge it."
→ Triggered by InfluxDB relationship_progression trend crossing threshold
```

**Scenario 4: Predictive Care**
```
[Bot detects declining emotional trend]
→ Temporal pattern analysis:
  1. Emotion score decreasing over 14 days (trend: -0.22)
  2. Conversation frequency dropped 40%
  3. Topics shifted from positive (hobbies) to negative (work stress)
  4. Similar pattern preceded previous depressive episode
→ Proactive check-in: "I've noticed you've been a bit quieter lately - 
                        everything okay? Want to talk about what's going on?"
```

### Statistical Analysis Capabilities

**Trend Direction Classification**:
```python
class TrendDirection(Enum):
    IMPROVING = "improving"    # Positive slope, increasing values
    DECLINING = "declining"    # Negative slope, decreasing values
    STABLE = "stable"          # Minimal slope, consistent values
    VOLATILE = "volatile"      # High variance, unpredictable
```

**Trend Analysis Output**:
```python
@dataclass
class TrendAnalysis:
    direction: TrendDirection
    slope: float              # Rate of change per day
    confidence: float         # Statistical confidence (0-1)
    current_value: float
    average_value: float
    volatility: float         # Standard deviation
    data_points: int
    time_span_days: int
```

**Correlation Detection**:
```python
# Identify what user behaviors correlate with emotional changes
correlations = {
    "photography_mentions": +0.58,  # Photography discussions → happier
    "work_stress_mentions": -0.44,   # Work stress → sadder
    "luna_mentions": +0.67,          # Dog mentions → happier
    "sleep_quality": +0.52           # Better sleep → better mood
}
```

### InfluxDB Query Patterns

**Emotion Trajectory Query**:
```flux
from(bucket: "performance_metrics")
  |> range(start: -90d)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "user_emotion")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r.user_id == "universal_id_123")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r.bot == "elena")
  |> aggregateWindow(every: 1d, fn: mean)
  |> yield(name: "emotion_trend")
```

**Relationship Progression Query**:
```flux
from(bucket: "performance_metrics")
  |> range(start: -30d)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "relationship_progression")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r.user_id == "universal_id_123")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r.bot == "elena")
  |> pivot(rowKey:["_time"], columnKey: ["_field"], valueColumn: "_value")
  |> sort(columns: ["_time"], desc: false)
```

**Conversation Quality Trend Query**:
```flux
from(bucket: "performance_metrics")
  |> range(start: -7d)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "conversation_quality")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r.user_id == "universal_id_123")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r.bot == "elena")
  |> aggregateWindow(every: 1d, fn: mean)
  |> yield(name: "quality_trend")
```
