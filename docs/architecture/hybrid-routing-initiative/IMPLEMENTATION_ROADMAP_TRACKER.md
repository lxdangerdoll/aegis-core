## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Resolved (Week 1) ✅
1. ✅ **Duplicate Classification System:** Eliminated HybridQueryRouter + ToolExecutor duplicates (-1,026 lines)
2. ✅ **Tool 3 (query_character_backstory):** Fully implemented with PostgreSQL CDL queries
3. ✅ **Tool 5 (query_temporal_trends):** Fully implemented with InfluxDB time-series queries
4. ✅ **InfluxDB Rx Loop Bug:** Fixed with SYNCHRONOUS mode, singleton pattern applied
5. ✅ **No Automated Tests:** Created comprehensive test suite (3 test files, 389 lines)

### Outstanding (Week 3-4 Focus)
1. **bot_self_memory_system.py Refactor:** Uses outdated JSON parsing instead of PostgreSQL
   - Lines 77-85: Replace JSON file reading with EnhancedCDLManager queries
   - Update to query 53+ character_* tables (character_relationships, character_background, etc.)
   - Priority: 🔴 HIGH (prerequisite for self-reflection tools)

2. **Hybrid Storage Architecture for Self-Reflections:**
   - **PostgreSQL**: Primary storage with full structured data (new `bot_self_reflections` table)
   - **Qdrant**: Semantic index in isolated namespace (`bot_self_{bot_name}`)
   - **InfluxDB**: Time-series metrics for trending and performance correlation
   - Benefits: Structured queries (PostgreSQL) + Semantic search (Qdrant) + Analytics (InfluxDB)

3. **Enrichment Worker Integration:**
   - Self-reflection runs ASYNC in background (zero impact on message processing hot path)
   - Time-based triggers: Every 2 hours, analyze recent conversations
   - Event-based triggers: High emotion, user feedback, conversation abandonment
   - Quality filters: Message count >= 5, emotional engagement, novel situations

### Future Improvements (Week 6-7)
1. **Caching:** Add prompt caching for CDL data (Technique 2 - Advanced Techniques)
2. **Cross-Encoder:** Improve memory retrieval precision +15-25% (Technique 1)
3. **Guardrails:** Add safety and format compliance (Technique 4)
4. **Active Learning:** Bot-initiated clarification questions (Technique 6 - depends on Bot Self-Memory)

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- **Oct 27:** Start Week 1 implementation immediately (don't wait for bot_self_memory refactor)
- **Oct 27:** Test with 3 bots (Jake/Ryan for memory, Elena for personality)
- **Oct 27:** Implement all 5 tools in Week 1 (complete foundation)
- **Oct 27:** Use incremental refactor approach for bot_self_memory_system.py

### Architecture Decisions
- **Hybrid Routing Strategy:** 80% semantic (fast) / 20% tool calling (accurate)
- **Complexity Threshold:** Default 0.3, configurable for A/B testing
- **Tool Naming:** query_character_backstory shared between Hybrid Router and Bot Self-Memory
  - Uses "source" parameter (cdl_database | self_memory | both)
- **No Feature Flags:** Tools work by default, use enable_tool_calling flag only for A/B testing

### Implementation Patterns
- **Protocol-Based:** Uses existing factory patterns (LLM client, memory system)
- **Character-Agnostic:** All tools use dynamic character loading via environment variables
- **Database-Driven:** PostgreSQL CDL system is single source of truth
- **Vector-Native:** Qdrant collections per bot for complete isolation
