# Integration Guide: WhisperEngine Discord Bot Health Monitoring

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: WhisperEngine is Discord-only. This guide covers health monitoring endpoints, not chat functionality.**

This guide shows how health check endpoints integrate with existing WhisperEngine bots for monitoring and debugging.

## Automatic Integration

Health check endpoints are automatically available on all WhisperEngine bots through the health server. No additional setup is required.

### How It Works

1. **Container Health**: Docker orchestration can monitor bot health
2. **Development Debugging**: Check bot initialization and component status
3. **Monitoring Integration**: External monitoring systems can track bot status
4. **No Discord Dependency**: Health checks work even if Discord is unavailable

### Available Endpoints

When you start any bot with `./multi-bot.sh start <bot_name>`, these endpoints become available:

**Health & Status Only:**
- `GET /health` - Basic health check for container orchestration
- `GET /status` - Detailed bot configuration and system status

**No Chat Endpoints:**
- ‚ùå All chat APIs have been removed
- ‚ùå External chat functionality discontinued  
- ‚úÖ Discord messages required for conversations

### Port Mapping

Each bot runs on its own port for health monitoring:

- **Elena** (Marine Biologist): Port 9091
- **Marcus** (AI Researcher): Port 9092
- **Ryan** (Indie Game Developer): Port 9093
- **Dream** (Mythological): Port 9094
- **Gabriel** (British Gentleman): Port 9095
- **Sophia** (Marketing Executive): Port 9096
- **Jake** (Adventure Photographer): Port 9097
- **Aethys** (Omnipotent): Port 3007

### Testing Health Endpoints

```bash
# Start any bot
./multi-bot.sh start elena

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:9091/health

# Check bot status
curl http://localhost:9091/status

# Monitor bot logs
docker logs whisperengine-elena-bot -f
```

### Discord Integration

**For conversation features:**
- Send Discord DMs to Elena, Marcus, Ryan, etc.
- Use bots in Discord channels where they're invited
- All AI intelligence, memory, and character features work via Discord

**Example Discord Interaction:**
```
You ‚Üí Elena (via Discord DM): "Hello! Tell me about marine biology."

Elena: "¬°Ay! *adjusts diving mask* You've come to the right marine biologist! 
The ocean is like an alien world right here on Earth, filled with calcium 
carbonate coral structures and bioluminescent deep-sea creatures. 
What aspect interests you most? üåäüê†"
```

### Container Orchestration

Health endpoints enable Docker/Kubernetes monitoring:

```yaml
# Docker Compose health check example
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9091/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

## Architecture Benefits

‚úÖ **Container Health Monitoring** - Docker orchestration support  
‚úÖ **Development Debugging** - Bot status visibility during development  
‚úÖ **Production Monitoring** - External monitoring system integration  
‚úÖ **Discord Focus** - All conversation intelligence via Discord only  
‚úÖ **No Performance Impact** - Health checks don't affect Discord performance  

The External Chat API provides a seamless way to extend WhisperEngine capabilities to external systems while maintaining the sophisticated AI processing that makes each character unique.
