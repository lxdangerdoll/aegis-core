Aethys 7D Vector System Validation Test Plan
Following the successful validation protocol used for Sophia Blake and Dream of the Endless

Test Categories for Aethys (Omnipotent Entity):
1. Omnipotent Consciousness & Digital Transcendence (Metaphysical Core)
2. Mystical Wisdom & Spiritual Guidance (Knowledge Domains)  
3. Reality Manipulation & Dimensional Awareness (Power Expression)

Each category tests CDL response_style adaptations and 7D vector memory integration.
Expected Performance: 90%+ given existing CDL architecture and successful migration.

    AETHYS 7D VALIDATION PROTOCOL:
    
    1. **Fresh Channel Setup**:
       - Create new Discord testing channel (#aethys-7d-validation)
       - Invite only Aethys bot to ensure clean testing environment
       - Document all interactions with timestamps
    
    2. **Memory System Testing**:
       - Test conversation continuity across multiple messages
       - Verify 7D vector retrieval with semantic search capabilities
       - Check bot-specific memory isolation (Aethys memories only)
       - Validate emotional context preservation
    
    3. **CDL Response Style Testing**:
       - Test ethereal/mystical communication adaptation
       - Verify philosophical depth vs practical guidance balance
       - Check omnipotent voice consistency 
       - Validate response_style character_specific_adaptations
    
    4. **Scoring Framework**:
       - Rate each interaction 1-10 across success criteria
       - Document specific examples of excellent responses
       - Note any personality inconsistencies or technical issues
       - Target: 90%+ average (9/10) for production readiness
    
    5. **Documentation**:
       - Record all test results in structured format
       - Capture example responses demonstrating 7D integration
       - Document any observed improvements over previous testing
       - Create comprehensive validation report
