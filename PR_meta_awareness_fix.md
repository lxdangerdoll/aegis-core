# Context Switch Meta-Awareness Fix PR

## Problem
While our context switch detection is technically working (it successfully detects topic shifts, emotional shifts, etc.), the LLM responses lack the meta-awareness described in the validation report. The validation report shows Elena acknowledging context switches with statements like:

> (And for the record, your curiosity about coral bleaching mechanisms is fascinatingâ€”we can circle back to the Symbiodinium oxidative stress pathways anytime you're ready.)

However, in actual conversations, Elena doesn't demonstrate this meta-awareness. The issue is not with the detection itself, but with how the detected context switches are incorporated into the prompt.

## Root Cause
The problem is in `src/platforms/universal_chat.py` where we add context switches to the prompt. Currently, we:
1. Detect context switches correctly
2. Add them as information to the prompt
3. BUT we don't include any instructions for Elena to acknowledge these switches in her response

## Fix
This PR adds meta-awareness instructions to the prompt when context switches are detected. For each context switch, we add specific instructions based on the adaptation strategy:

```python
# Add strategy-based instructions for meta-awareness
if adaptation_strategy == "acknowledge_transition" or adaptation_strategy == "acknowledge_topic_change":
    meta_awareness_instructions.append(f"Acknowledge the topic change from {previous_topic} to {new_topic} with a brief meta-comment")
    meta_awareness_instructions.append("Include a bridge between the topics in your response")
elif adaptation_strategy == "emotional_validation":
    meta_awareness_instructions.append(f"Acknowledge the emotional shift and validate both emotional states")
# ... other strategies ...
```

These instructions guide the LLM to explicitly show awareness of the conversation shift, creating the meta-awareness described in the validation report.

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Restart Elena's bot with `./multi-bot.sh restart elena`
2. Send this test message:
   ```
   Can you explain the technical details of coral bleaching mechanisms? I need to understand the molecular processes involved in zooxanthellae expulsion for my research paper.

   Wait, never mind the science stuff - I just need someone to talk to about feeling overwhelmed with work.
   ```
3. Verify that Elena's response includes meta-awareness of the topic shift, such as acknowledging the initial request and offering to revisit it later.

## Impact
This fix completes the context switch detection system by ensuring that not only are context switches detected, but they are also acknowledged in the response, creating a more natural and aware conversation flow.
