Example Integration: Persistent Conversation Tracking in WhisperEngine

This demonstrates how the persistent conversation tracking enhances WhisperEngine's
conversation flow by maintaining continuity across interactions.

BEFORE (without persistent tracking):
Bot: "What's your favorite ocean creature?"
User: *changes topic* "Tell me about the weather"
Bot: *follows new topic without remembering the question*

AFTER (with persistent tracking):
Bot: "What's your favorite ocean creature?"
User: *changes topic* "Tell me about the weather"
Bot: *responds to weather, then naturally circles back*
    "The weather's nice today! By the way, I'm still curious - 
     what's your favorite ocean creature? I'd love to hear about it."

========================================
INTEGRATION POINTS IN WHISPERENGINE
========================================

1. QUESTION EXTRACTION & TRACKING (in _generate_and_send_response):
   - Bot sends: "What's your favorite marine animal?"
   - System extracts question and tracks it
   - Assigned priority and type for future handling

2. ANSWER DETECTION (in _generate_and_send_response):
   - User responds: "I love dolphins!"
   - System detects this answers the pending question
   - Marks question as resolved with quality score

3. CONVERSATION CONTEXT (in _build_conversation_context):
   - System checks for unanswered questions
   - Adds natural reminder context for high-priority unresolved questions
   - Bot naturally incorporates reminders: "I'm still curious about..."

4. CONVERSATION HEALTH MONITORING:
   - Tracks question/answer ratios
   - Identifies conversation issues (too many unanswered questions)
   - Provides guidance for better engagement

========================================
EXAMPLE CONVERSATION FLOW
========================================

Elena: "What fascinates you most about marine ecosystems? üåä"
[SYSTEM: Tracks question - type=OPINION, priority=MEDIUM]

User: "I've been thinking about getting a new job"
[SYSTEM: Detects topic change, no answer to pending question]

Elena: "Career transitions can be exciting! What field are you considering? 
       Also, I'm still curious about what fascinates you about marine ecosystems - 
       there's so much incredible diversity to explore."
[SYSTEM: Natural reminder incorporated into response]

User: "I love how everything is connected - the food chains, the coral reefs supporting so much life"
[SYSTEM: Detects answer, resolves question with quality=0.92]

Elena: "That interconnectedness is incredible! The symbiotic relationships in coral 
       reefs create these vibrant underwater cities. Have you ever seen a reef in person?"
[SYSTEM: Tracks new follow-up question - type=PERSONAL, priority=LOW]

========================================
KEY BENEFITS
========================================

‚úÖ CONVERSATION CONTINUITY: Questions don't get lost when topics change
‚úÖ NATURAL REMINDERS: Bot circles back without being pushy  
‚úÖ ENGAGEMENT TRACKING: Monitor conversation health and quality
‚úÖ PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY: Each character handles follow-ups in their unique style
‚úÖ ADAPTIVE PRIORITY: Important questions persist, casual ones fade naturally
‚úÖ USER EXPERIENCE: Conversations feel more human-like and considerate

========================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
========================================

The system is integrated into WhisperEngine's event handlers at three key points:

1. BotEventHandlers.__init__():
   - Initializes PersistentConversationManager
   - Connects to memory system for persistence

2. _build_conversation_context():
   - Checks for pending questions
   - Adds natural reminder context to system prompts
   
3. _generate_and_send_response():
   - Extracts questions from bot responses
   - Processes user responses for answers
   - Tracks conversation health

The system works seamlessly with WhisperEngine's existing:
- Vector memory system (for persistence)
- CDL character personalities (for character-appropriate reminders)
- Multi-bot architecture (isolated per bot)
- Conversation caching (for recent context)
