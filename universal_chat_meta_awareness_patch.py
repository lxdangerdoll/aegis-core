"""
Meta-Awareness Fix Patch - Adds explicit instructions for context switch acknowledgment

This patch file contains the code that should be added to src/platforms/universal_chat.py
to include meta-awareness instructions when context switches are detected.

The original context switch detection system is working correctly, but it doesn't instruct
the LLM to acknowledge the switches in its response, which is why Elena doesn't show the
meta-awareness described in the validation report.
