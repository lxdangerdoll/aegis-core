## 🔍 What The Features Do

### Memory Trigger Enhancement
- **What**: User facts from conversation trigger character memories
- **Example**: You mention "coral reefs" → Elena recalls her coral research memories
- **Log Pattern**: `Extracted user fact: coral reefs` → `Triggering memories`

### Emotional Context Synchronization  
- **What**: Memories are ranked by alignment with your current emotion
- **Example**: You're sad → Elena prioritizes empathetic/comforting memories
- **Log Pattern**: `primary_emotion: sadness` → `Ranked by emotional alignment`

## 💡 Testing Tips

**For Best Results:**
1. ✨ Use emotionally charged language ("excited!", "depressing", "inspiring")
2. 🌊 Mention marine biology topics (Elena's domain expertise)
3. 🔄 Test emotional shifts in same conversation
4. 📊 Watch monitoring logs for feature activation
5. 📝 Check prompt logs for context being sent to LLM

**Warning Signs:**
- No logs appearing → Check monitoring script is running
- No emotion detected → Try more expressive language
- No memories triggered → Mention specific topics (coral, ocean, conservation)
