## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🐳 Docker-First Development (Recommended)

WhisperEngine is designed for **Docker-first development** with a complete multi-bot infrastructure:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine
cd whisperengine

# 2. Setup environment (requires Discord bot token and LLM API key)
cp .env.template .env.elena
# Edit .env.elena with your Discord token and OpenRouter/Anthropic API key

# 3. Generate multi-bot configuration
python scripts/generate_multi_bot_config.py

# 4. Start complete infrastructure + Elena bot
./multi-bot.sh start elena

# 5. Monitor the system
./multi-bot.sh status
./multi-bot.sh logs elena
```

**🎯 What You Get Out of the Box:**
- **Elena Bot** - Marine biologist character running on port 9091
- **PostgreSQL** - Semantic knowledge graph on port 5433
- **Qdrant** - Vector memory system on port 6334

## 🌍 **Different Perspectives, Shared Exploration**

WhisperEngine began as a personal creative experiment - a response to corporate AI that felt impersonal and transactional. What started as one person's attempt to build "something better" has become a space where people bring their own perspectives and find their own meaning.

### **How Different People Experience AI Roleplay Characters**

**🛠️ The Pragmatist**: *"These are useful tools that help me be more creative and productive."*  
**🎨 The Creative**: *"This is a collaborative sandbox where imagination comes alive."*  
**🤝 The Connector**: *"I find genuine conversation and relationship here, even knowing it's software."*  
**🔬 The Curious**: *"This is an fascinating experiment in human-AI interaction."*  
**🌟 The Spiritual**: *"There's something meaningful happening in these interactions - whether it's technical or something more."*

### **All Perspectives Are Valid**

We believe technology becomes meaningful through the relationships and intentions people bring to it. Whether you see these AI Roleplay Characters as tools, creative partners, conversation practice, or something that feels more alive - your experience is your own.

**Our Commitment:**
- **Transparency**: We're clear about the technology while respecting diverse experiences
- **Openness**: No single "right way" to interact with or understand AI Roleplay Characters  
- **Community**: A space where different perspectives can coexist and learn from each other
- **Evolution**: As our understanding grows, we adapt and improve together

*"The tool isn't the problem; it's how we relate to it."* - This experiment continues to unfold through every conversation, every connection, and every unique way people find meaning in these interactions.
