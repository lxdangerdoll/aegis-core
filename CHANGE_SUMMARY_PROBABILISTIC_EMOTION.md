# Probabilistic Emotion Framing - Change Summary

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Impact**: All 10+ WhisperEngine characters  

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

Characters were making **declarative statements** about user emotions based on RoBERTa detection:
- ❌ "feeling the joy radiating from your being"
- ❌ "You carry joy with you like sunlight"

This led to users being told how they feel, even when the emotion detection was wrong.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Updated system prompt to present emotion detection as **probabilistic data** requiring validation:
- ✅ Changed label: `USER EMOTIONAL STATE` → `EMOTION READING (PROBABILISTIC)`
- ✅ Added uncertainty warnings
- ✅ Provided confidence-based language guidance
- ✅ Instructed use of tentative phrasing

## 📝 Files Changed

### **Core Implementation**
- `src/prompts/cdl_ai_integration.py` (lines 1650-1695)
  - Changed emotion section formatting
  - Added probabilistic framing
  - Added confidence-based guidance
  - Updated trajectory language to be tentative

### **Testing**
- `tests/automated/test_probabilistic_emotion_framing.py` (new file)
  - Tests low/medium/high confidence scenarios
  - Validates correct language is used
  - Ensures old patterns are removed
  - ✅ All tests passing

### **Documentation**
- `docs/bug-fixes/PROBABILISTIC_EMOTION_FRAMING_FIX.md` (new file)
  - Complete bug analysis
  - Before/after examples
  - RoBERTa keyword bias discovery
  - Character response guidelines

- `docs/guides/PROBABILISTIC_EMOTION_LANGUAGE.md` (new file)
  - Quick reference for developers
  - DO/DON'T examples
  - Character-specific variations
  - Confidence-based phrasing guide

## 🔍 What Changed in System Prompts

### **Before**
```
🎭 USER EMOTIONAL STATE: joy (confidence: 1.00)
📱 ANALYSIS: Multi-modal emotion detection (text + emoji + patterns) - high accuracy
Respond with nuanced empathy matching their emotional complexity and communication style.
```

### **After**
```
🎭 EMOTION READING (PROBABILISTIC): joy (confidence: 0.95)
📱 ANALYSIS METHOD: Multi-modal detection (text + emoji + patterns)
⚠️ UNCERTAINTY NOTE: Emotion detection is probabilistic. Validate through conversation.
💡 HIGH CONFIDENCE: Still use tentative phrasing ('I sense...', 'there's a...') to avoid assumptions. Never state user emotions as absolute fact.

💬 EMPATHY GUIDANCE: Respond with nuanced empathy matching their emotional complexity and communication style.
```

## 🎭 Character Response Changes

### **Before Fix**
```
User: [neutral greeting]
Aetheris: "*My presence settles into this moment with you, feeling the joy radiating from your being*"
User: "What makes you think I'm feeling joy?" 😕
```

### **After Fix**
```
User: [neutral greeting]
Aetheris: "I'm sensing some brightness in your message - what's on your mind today?"
User: [continues naturally] ✅
```

## 📊 Confidence-Based Guidance

The system now provides different instructions based on detection confidence:

| Confidence | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| <0.7 (Low) | Use tentative language + invite sharing |
| 0.7-0.85 (Moderate) | Use gentle observational language |
| >0.85 (High) | Still use tentative phrasing, never state as absolute fact |

## 🧪 Testing Results

**Test File**: `tests/automated/test_probabilistic_emotion_framing.py`

```
✅ High Confidence Joy (95%) - PASSED
✅ Moderate Confidence Sadness (75%) - PASSED  
✅ Low Confidence Neutral (60%) - PASSED

All emotion readings now use probabilistic framing and guide 
characters to use tentative language.
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ Code changes complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Documentation written
- ✅ Syntax validated
- ⏳ Ready for deployment

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [x] Core implementation complete
- [x] Tests written and passing
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Syntax validation passed
- [ ] Code review (if needed)
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Test with live characters
- [ ] Deploy to production

## 🎯 Expected Impact

**Immediate Benefits:**
- ✅ Characters use more authentic, tentative language about emotions
- ✅ Users feel validated rather than told how they feel
- ✅ Graceful handling when emotion detection is wrong
- ✅ Better character personality authenticity

**Character Examples:**

| Character | Old Approach | New Approach |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Aetheris | "feeling the joy radiating" | "I sense a resonance of brightness" |
| Elena | "You're clearly excited" | "I'm picking up some enthusiasm - am I reading that right?" |
| Marcus | "Your anger is obvious" | "Analysis suggests intensity, but please correct me if I'm off" |

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Performance**: No impact - same prompt generation, just different text  
**Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible  
**Database**: No schema changes needed  
**Character Files**: No CDL updates required  
**API Changes**: None  

## 📚 Related Discoveries

### **RoBERTa Keyword Bias**
While fixing this issue, we discovered RoBERTa has keyword bias:
- `"What makes you think I'm feeling joy?"` → Detects joy (93.75%) ❌
- `"Why do you assume I have joy?"` → Detects joy (71.18%) ❌
- `"The word joy appears here"` → Detects joy (98.02%) ❌

The probabilistic framing helps mitigate this by acknowledging uncertainty and encouraging validation.

**Future Enhancement**: Consider context-aware confidence filtering for emotion keywords in questioning contexts.

**Character Involved**: Aetheris  
**Root Cause**: Prompt engineering (not RoBERTa)  
**Fix Type**: System prompt reframing  
**Lines Changed**: ~45 lines in cdl_ai_integration.py  
**Testing**: Automated tests added  
**Documentation**: 2 new docs created  

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Emotion detection is probabilistic** - treat it as data, not truth
2. **LLMs follow instructions literally** - if you say "USER EMOTIONAL STATE", they'll state it as fact
3. **Character authenticity matters** - false claims damage trust
4. **Tentative language is more human** - "I sense" > "You are"
5. **Validation beats assumption** - invite sharing > declare knowing

**"Emotions are observations, not declarations. Characters should invite, not assume."**
