Clean Contaminated Bot-Bridge Memories

Deletes all bot-bridge conversation memories between two specified bots.
This is needed when the bot bridge script had reversed identities, causing
memory contamination where each bot stored messages with wrong user_id mappings.

Usage:
    python scripts/clean_bot_bridge_memories.py dotty nottaylor
    python scripts/clean_bot_bridge_memories.py --dry-run dotty nottaylor
