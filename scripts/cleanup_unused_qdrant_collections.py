WhisperEngine Vector Storage Cleanup Script

This script identifies and deletes Qdrant collections that are no longer in use.
It scans the .env.* files to determine which collections are actively configured,
then deletes any collections that aren't being used.

USAGE:
  python scripts/cleanup_unused_qdrant_collections.py [--dry-run] [--confirm]

OPTIONS:
  --dry-run    Don't actually delete collections, just show what would be deleted
  --confirm    Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with deletion
