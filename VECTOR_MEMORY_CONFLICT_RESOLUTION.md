# 🔄 Conflict Resolution in WhisperEngine Vector Memory System

## Overview

WhisperEngine's simplified vector memory system includes sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms that handle contradictory information in user conversations. Here's how it works:

## 🎯 Current Conflict Resolution Strategy

### 1. **Contradiction Detection**

The system uses multiple approaches to detect conflicting information:

#### **Method A: Semantic Similarity Analysis**
```python
async def detect_contradictions(self, new_content: str, user_id: str, similarity_threshold: float = 0.85):
    """
    Detects contradictions using semantic similarity between embeddings
    
    Logic:
    - High semantic similarity (>85%) + Different text content = Potential contradiction
    - Uses cosine similarity between vector embeddings
    - Focuses on FACT and PREFERENCE memory types
    """
```

**Example:**
- Existing: "My goldfish is named Orion" 
- New: "My goldfish is named Bubbles"
- **Result**: High semantic similarity (both about goldfish names) but different content → Contradiction detected

#### **Method B: Qdrant Recommendation API**
```python
async def resolve_contradictions_with_qdrant(self, user_id: str, semantic_key: str, new_memory_content: str):
    """
    Uses Qdrant's advanced recommendation API for intelligent contradiction detection
    
    Logic:
    - Finds memories semantically similar to new content (positive examples)
    - Excludes memories with identical content (negative examples)
    - Leverages "semantic" named vector for concept-level matching
    """
```

**Advanced Features:**
- Uses named vectors: `content`, `emotion`, `semantic`
- Recommendation scoring for conflict confidence
- Context-aware similarity thresholds

### 2. **Conflict Resolution Strategies**

#### **Strategy A: Intelligent Ranking with Temporal Decay**
```python
async def _intelligent_ranking(self, raw_results, query, prefer_recent=True, resolve_contradictions=True):
    """
    Resolves conflicts by ranking memories based on multiple factors:
    
    Ranking Formula: confidence × temporal_weight × original_similarity_score
    
    Where:
    - confidence: User-specified or system-calculated confidence (0.1-1.0)
    - temporal_weight: Time-based decay (90% after 1 day, 50% after 7 days, 10% after 30 days)
    - original_similarity_score: Vector similarity to query
    """
```

**Resolution Logic:**
1. **Group by Semantic Key**: Group memories about same concept (e.g., "pet_name", "favorite_color")
2. **Rank within Groups**: Sort by composite score (confidence × time × relevance)
3. **Keep Best Memory**: Select highest-scored memory as authoritative
4. **Mark Superseded**: Flag lower-scored memories as superseded

#### **Strategy B: Semantic Key Grouping**
```python
def _get_semantic_key(self, content: str) -> str:
    """
    Groups related facts for conflict resolution:
    
    - 'pet_name': "cat/dog/pet" + "name" → Groups all pet naming facts
    - 'favorite_color': "favorite color"/"like color" → Groups color preferences  
    - 'user_name': "my name is"/"i am called" → Groups user identity facts
    - 'user_location': "live in"/"from"/"location" → Groups location facts
    """
```

### 3. **Memory Update Mechanisms**

#### **Direct Memory Update**
```python
async def update_memory(self, memory_id: str, new_content: str, reason: str) -> bool:
    """
    Updates existing memory with new information
    
    Process:
    1. Retrieve existing memory by ID
    2. Generate new embeddings for all named vectors (content, emotion, semantic)
    3. Update payload with new content + correction metadata
    4. Store updated vectors back to Qdrant
    """
```

#### **Memory Replacement Strategy**
When contradictions are detected:
- **High Confidence New Info**: Replace old memory entirely
- **Low Confidence**: Mark as "needs_verification" and keep both
- **Merge Strategy**: Combine compatible information when possible

## 🔍 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Pet Name Correction
```
User: "My cat is named Whiskers"
→ Stored as: memory_1 {content: "My cat is named Whiskers", semantic_key: "pet_name"}

User: "Actually, my cat is named Luna"
→ Contradiction detected: High semantic similarity (both about cat names)
→ Resolution: Replace memory_1 with new content
→ Result: Only "My cat is named Luna" remains active
```

### Example 2: Preference Evolution
```
User: "I love chocolate ice cream"
→ Stored as: memory_1 {content: "I love chocolate ice cream", confidence: 0.8}

User: "I think vanilla is better than chocolate now"
→ Contradiction detected: Conflicting preference statements
→ Resolution: Keep newer preference (temporal decay favors recent)
→ Result: Vanilla preference supersedes chocolate preference
```

### Example 3: Complex Context Resolution
```
User: "I work at Microsoft"
→ Stored as: memory_1 {content: "I work at Microsoft", confidence: 0.9}

User: "I just started my new job at Google"
→ Contradiction detected: Different employer facts
→ Resolution: New job overwrites old job (temporal + context)
→ Additional: Mark transition with metadata for relationship building
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### **Multi-Vector Conflict Detection**
The system uses 3 named vectors for sophisticated analysis:

1. **Content Vector**: Direct semantic meaning
2. **Emotion Vector**: Emotional context and sentiment
3. **Semantic Vector**: Conceptual relationships

```python
# Triple-vector contradiction analysis
content_similarity = cosine_similarity(new_content_vec, existing_content_vec)
semantic_similarity = cosine_similarity(new_semantic_vec, existing_semantic_vec) 
emotion_similarity = cosine_similarity(new_emotion_vec, existing_emotion_vec)

# Conflict if: high semantic + low content + different emotion
if semantic_similarity > 0.8 and content_similarity < 0.7:
    contradiction_confidence = semantic_similarity - content_similarity
```

### **Qdrant-Native Intelligence**
Leverages Qdrant's built-in capabilities:

- **Recommendation API**: Find related but different memories
- **Named Vector Search**: Multi-dimensional similarity
- **Payload Filtering**: Efficient user/bot/type filtering
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk updates

### **Temporal Intelligence** 
- **Decay Functions**: Older memories lose relevance over time
- **Context Windows**: Recent context gets priority
- **Relationship Continuity**: Important memories resist decay

## 🛡️ Safeguards and Edge Cases

### **Confidence Thresholds**
```python
# Conservative conflict detection
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.85  # Strong contradiction evidence required
LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7    # Weaker evidence preserved for review

# Resolution strategies by confidence
if contradiction_confidence > HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
    strategy = "replace"  # Confident replacement
elif contradiction_confidence > LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
    strategy = "flag_review"  # Human review recommended  
else:
    strategy = "keep_both"  # Insufficient evidence to resolve
```

### **Memory Type Handling**
```python
# Different strategies by memory type
CONFLICT_STRATEGIES = {
    MemoryType.FACT: "replace_with_latest",      # Facts should be accurate
    MemoryType.PREFERENCE: "temporal_decay",     # Preferences evolve
    MemoryType.CONVERSATION: "preserve_all",     # Conversations are historical
    MemoryType.CONTEXT: "merge_compatible",      # Context is additive
    MemoryType.RELATIONSHIP: "careful_merge"     # Relationships are complex
}
```

### **Bot Isolation**
All conflict resolution respects bot-specific memory:
```python
# Conflicts only detected within same bot's memories
must_conditions = [
    models.FieldCondition(key="user_id", match=models.MatchValue(value=user_id)),
    models.FieldCondition(key="bot_name", match=models.MatchValue(value=current_bot_name))
]
```

Elena's memories never conflict with Marcus's memories, even for the same user.

await memory_manager.store_conversation(
    user_id=user_id,
    user_message="My favorite food is pizza",
    bot_response="I'll remember you love pizza!",
    metadata={
        "confidence": 0.9,  # High confidence explicit statement
        "memory_type": "preference",
        "subject": "food_preference"
    }
)
```

### **Contradiction Handling**
```python
# Check for contradictions before major decisions
contradictions = await memory_store.detect_contradictions(
    new_content=user_statement,
    user_id=user_id,
    similarity_threshold=0.8  # Adjust based on sensitivity needs
)

if contradictions:
    # Handle conflicts gracefully
    await handle_user_correction(contradictions, user_statement)
```

### **Query Optimization**
```python
# Use contradiction resolution in queries for consistent results
results = await memory_store.search_memories_with_qdrant_intelligence(
    query=user_question,
    user_id=user_id,
    resolve_contradictions=True,  # Get consistent facts only
    prefer_recent=True,           # Favor recent information
    limit=10
)
```
