# WhisperEngine Platform-Specific Dependencies
# Platform optimizations and system-specific packages
# All versions locked for reproducible builds

# Cross-platform system utilities
psutil==7.1.0  # System and process utilities (already in core, kept for compatibility)

# Platform-specific optimizations
# Currently minimal - can be extended with platform markers like:
# some-package==1.0.0; sys_platform == "win32"
# other-package==2.0.0; sys_platform == "linux"

# No additional platform-specific dependencies at this time
# This file exists for future platform optimizations
