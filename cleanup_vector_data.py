üóëÔ∏è Vector Data Cleanup Script

Since WhisperEngine is in ALPHA/DEV phase with no production users,
we can safely delete all vector data and start fresh with proper
named vector format.

This script:
1. Connects to Qdrant
2. Deletes the whisperengine_memories collection  
3. Recreates it with proper named vector configuration
4. Confirms the cleanup was successful

Usage:
    python cleanup_vector_data.py
    
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will delete ALL vector memories for ALL bots!
Only safe because we're in development phase.
