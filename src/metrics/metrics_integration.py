Metrics Integration - TEMPORARILY DISABLED

This integration layer depends on HolisticAIMetrics which has been removed
in favor of InfluxDB-only metrics collection via FidelityMetricsCollector.

TODO: Update this integration to work with InfluxDB directly
instead of the removed HolisticAIMetrics system.

For now, this file is preserved but not actively used.
