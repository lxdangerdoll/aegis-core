# Migration note for developers:
# This Neo4j-based example has been OBSOLETED and replaced by:
# 1. PostgreSQL semantic knowledge graph in main WhisperEngine bot
# 2. CDL character system for personality-driven responses
# 3. Qdrant vector memory for conversation intelligence
# 
# See src/core/bot.py for the current production bot implementation.
